    <title>OpenStack API Quick Start</title>
    <para>The OpenStack system has several key projects that are
        separate installations but can work together depending on your
        cloud needs: OpenStack Compute, OpenStack Object Storage,
        OpenStack Identity Service, and OpenStack Image Store.
        With The Free Cloud OpenStack installation, the OpenStack Compute, OpenStack Identity, and OpenStack Image Store projects 
        are all working together in the background of the installation. </para>

        <title>OpenStack API Introduction</title>
    <para>This page covers the basics for talking to your OpenStack
            cloud through the Compute API after authorizing with the
            Identity Service API. You can then build a cloud by
            launching images and assigning metadata to instances, all
            through the API. For an API reference of all the possible
            commands, see the <link xlink:href="http://docs.openstack.org/api/openstack-compute/1.1/content/">OpenStack Compute API 1.1 specification</link>
        and the <link xlink:href="http://docs.openstack.org/api/openstack-identity-service/2.0/content/">Identity Service 2.0 specification</link> published at
                <link xlink:href="http://docs.openstack.org/api"

    <section xml:id="Getting-Credentials-a00665"><title>Getting Credentials</title><para>Credentials are a combination of your username, password, and what tenant (or project) your
            cloud is running under. You only need to generate an additional token if you are
            interacting with your cloud directly with API endpoints, and not with a client. Your
            cloud administrator can give you a username and a password as well as your tenant
            identifier so you can generate authorization tokens. These tokens are typically good for
            24 hours, and when the token expires, you will find out with a 401 (Unauthorized) error
            and can request another token programmatically. The general workflow goes something like
            this: </para>
    <orderedlist>
        <listitem><para>Begin API requests by asking for an authorization token from the endpoint your cloud
                    administrator gave you, typically http://hostname:port/v2.0/tokens. You send your
                    username, password, and what group or account you are with (the "tenant" in auth-speak). </para>

        <listitem><para>The server returns a response in which the 24-hours token is
                    contained.  Use that token to send API requests

                    field.</para></listitem>

                <para>Repeatedly send API requests with that token in the x-auth-token header until

                </para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>

    <para>For a typical OpenStack deployment running the Identity
            Service you can request a token with this command in
            cURL:<programlisting>
$ curl -X 'POST' -v https://nova-api.trystack.org:5443/v2.0/tokens -d '{"auth":{"passwordCredentials":{"username": "joecool", "password":"coolword"}, "tenantId":"5"}}' -H 'Content-type: application/json'
         </programlisting></para>
        <para>In return, you should get a 200 OK response with a token in the form of "id": "cd427a33-bb4a-4079-a6d7-0ae148bdeda9" and an expiration date 24 hours from now. Here's what it looks like:</para>

        <title>Sending Requests to the API</title>
        <para>You have a couple of options for sending requests to OpenStack through an API.
            Developers and testers may prefer to use cURL, the command-line tool from <link
                xlink:href="http://curl.haxx.se/">http://curl.haxx.se/</link>. With cURL you can
            send HTTP requests and receive responses back from the command line. </para>
        <para>If you like to use a more graphical interface, the REST client for Firefox also works
            well for testing and trying out commands, see <link
                xlink:href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/restclient/"
                >https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/restclient/</link>. You can also
            download and install rest-client, a Java application to test RESTful web services, from
                <link xlink:href="http://code.google.com/p/rest-client/"
                >http://code.google.com/p/rest-client/</link>. </para>
        <para>You need to generate a token as shown above if you use cURL or a REST client. </para>

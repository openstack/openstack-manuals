    <title>OpenStack API Quick Start</title>
    <para>The OpenStack system has several key projects that are separate installations but can work
        together depending on your cloud needs: OpenStack Compute, OpenStack Object Storage,
        OpenStack Identity Service, and OpenStack Image Store. With a standalone OpenStack
        installation such as the Rackspace Rapid Deployment Program, the OpenStack Compute,
        OpenStack Identity, and OpenStack Image Store projects are all working together in the
        background of your installation. </para>

        <title>OpenStack API Introduction</title>
    <para>This page covers the basics for talking to your OpenStack cloud through the Compute API
            after authorizing with the Identity Service API. You can then build a cloud by launching
            images and assigning metadata to instances, all through the API. For an API reference of
            all the possible commands, see the OpenStack Compute API 1.1 specification and the
            Identity Service 2.0 Developer Guide published at <link xlink:href="http://docs.openstack.org">docs.openstack.org</link>. </para></section>
    <section xml:id="Getting-Credentials-a00665"><title>Getting Credentials</title><para>Credentials are a combination of your username, password, and what tenant (or project) your
            cloud is running under. You only need to generate an additional token if you are
            interacting with your cloud directly with API endpoints, and not with a client. Your
            cloud administrator can give you a username and a password as well as your tenant
            identifier so you can generate authorization tokens. These tokens are typically good for
            24 hours, and when the token expires, you will find out with a 401 (Unauthorized) error
            and can request another token programmatically. The general workflow goes something like
            this: </para>

        <title>Sending Requests to the API</title>
        <para>You have a couple of options for sending requests to OpenStack through an API.
            Developers and testers may prefer to use cURL, the command-line tool from <link
                xlink:href="http://curl.haxx.se/">http://curl.haxx.se/</link>. With cURL you can
            send HTTP requests and receive responses back from the command line. </para>
        <para>If you like to use a more graphical interface, the REST client for Firefox also works
            well for testing and trying out commands, see <link

                >https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/restclient/</link>. You can also
            download and install rest-client, a Java application to test RESTful web services, from

                >http://code.google.com/p/rest-client/</link>. </para>
        <para>You need to generate a token as shown above if you use cURL or a REST client. </para>
        <para>For more serious scripting work, you can use a client like the python-novaclient or
            openstack-compute clients. The python-novaclient implements the Compute 1.1 API while
            the openstack-compute client works against the Rackspace Cloud Servers public cloud
            which is the OpenStack Compute 1.0 API. You only need a username and password to use the
            python-novaclient tool.  </para>

    <section xml:id="Setting-Up-python-novaclient-a03867"><title>Setting Up  python-novaclient</title><para>Installing the python-novaclient gives you a <code>nova</code> shell command that enables

    <para>
To launch a server, you choose an image you want to match up to a size, find the ID for the image and the ID for the flavor so you can size it, and create the command with the IDs. From the information we got previously, we know that an Ubuntu Maverick image has an ID of 15, and if you want to start small with about 2 GB of memory and 20 GB of disk space, you'd choose the m1.small flavor which has an ID of 2. Put those parameters in with the "boot" command and you can create a new virtual server.

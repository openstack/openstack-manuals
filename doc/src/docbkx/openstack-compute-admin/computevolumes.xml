        <para>You now have two options in terms of Block Storage.
            Currently (as of the Folsom release) both are nearly
            identical in terms of functionality, API's and even the
            general theory of operation. Keep in mind however that
            Nova-Volumes is deprecated and will be removed at the
            release of Grizzly. </para>

        <title>Managing Volumes</title>
        <para>Nova-volume is the service that allows you to give extra block level storage to your
            OpenStack Compute instances. You may recognize this as a similar offering from Amazon
            EC2 known as Elastic Block Storage (EBS). However, nova-volume is not the same
            implementation that EC2 uses today. Nova-volume is an iSCSI solution that employs the
            use of Logical Volume Manager (LVM) for Linux. Note that a volume may only be attached
            to one instance at a time. This is not a ‘shared storage’ solution like a SAN of NFS on
            which multiple servers can attach to.</para>

        <para>The nova-volumes service uses iSCSI-exposed LVM volumes to the compute nodes which run
            instances. Thus, there are two components involved: </para>

            <para>Ceph is a massively scalable, open source,
                distributed storage system. It is comprised of an
                object store, block store, and a POSIX-compliant
                distributed file system. The platform is capable of
                auto-scaling to the exabyte level and beyond, it runs
                on commodity hardware, it is self-healing and
                self-managing, and has no single point of failure.
                Ceph is in the Linux kernel and is integrated with the
                OpenStack™ cloud operating system. As a result of its
                open source nature, this portable storage platform may
                be installed and used in public or private clouds.<figure>

                    them for fault tolerance. It is built with 3 major

                            You must have this daemon running on each
                            server of your cluster. For each OSD you
                            can have an associated hard drive disks.
                            For performance purpose it’s usually

                    are ready for production. It could be really risky
                    to put them together. This is why XFS is an
                    excellent alternative to btrfs. The ext4

                <para>To allow the driver to communicate with the
                Storwize family or SVC system,
                you must provide the driver with
                a user on the storage system. The driver has two
                authentication methods: password-based
                authentication and SSH key pair authentication.
                The user should have an Administrator role.
                It is suggested to create a new
                user for the management driver.
                Please consult with your
                storage and security administrator regarding
                the preferred authentication method and how
                passwords or SSH keys should be stored in a
                secure manner. </para>

                <para>If you are using the SSH key pair

                private and public keys using the instructions
                below or by any other method.
                Associate the public key with the
                user by uploading the public key: select the
                "choose file" option in the Storwize family or
                SVC management GUI under "SSH public key".
                Alternatively, you may associate the SSH public
                key using the command line interface;
                details can be found in the
                Storwize and SVC documentation.
                The private key should
                be provided to the driver using the

                For example, if you select 'key' as the

                <literal>key.pub</literal>.
                The <literal>key</literal>
                file holds the private SSH key and
                <literal>key.pub</literal> holds the public
                SSH key.
                </para>
                <para>The command also prompts for a passphrase,
                which should be empty.</para>
                <para>The private key file should be provided to the

                                user friendly term to specify some
                                notion of quality of service. For
                                example, "gold" might mean that the

                                backups are possible. A flavor can be
                                associated with multiple backends. The
                                volume scheduler, with the help of the

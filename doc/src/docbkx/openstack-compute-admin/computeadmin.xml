    <title>System Administration</title>
    <para>By understanding how the different installed nodes interact with each other you can
        administer the OpenStack Compute installation. OpenStack Compute offers many ways to install
        using multiple servers but the general idea is that you can have multiple compute nodes that
        control the virtual servers and a cloud controller node that contains the remaining Nova services. </para>
    <para>The OpenStack Compute cloud works via the interaction of a series of daemon processes
        named nova-* that reside persistently on the host machine or machines. These binaries can
        all run on the same machine or be spread out on multiple boxes in a large deployment. The
        responsibilities of Services, Managers, and Drivers, can be a bit confusing at first. Here
        is an outline the division of responsibilities to make understanding the system a little bit
        easier. </para>
    <para>Currently, Services are nova-api, nova-objectstore (which can be replaced with Glance, the
        OpenStack Image Service), nova-compute, nova-volume, and nova-network. Managers and Drivers
        are specified by configuration options and loaded using utils.load_object(). Managers are responsible for a
        certain aspect of the system. It is a logical grouping of code relating to a portion of the
        system. In general other components should be using the manager to make changes to the
        components that it is responsible for. </para>
    <para>For example, other components that need to deal with volumes in some way, should do so by
        calling methods on the VolumeManager instead of directly changing fields in the database.
        This allows us to keep all of the code relating to volumes in the same place. </para>

            <para>nova-api - The nova-api service receives xml requests and sends them to the rest
                of the system. It is a wsgi app that routes and authenticate requests. It supports
                the EC2 and OpenStack APIs. There is a nova-api.conf file created when you install
                Compute.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>nova-objectstore - The nova-objectstore service is an ultra simple file-based
                storage system for images that replicates most of the S3 API. It can be replaced
                with OpenStack Image Service and a simple image manager or use OpenStack Object
                Storage as the virtual machine image storage facility. It must reside on the same
                node as nova-compute.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>nova-compute - The nova-compute service is responsible for managing virtual
                machines. It loads a Service object which exposes the public methods on
                ComputeManager via Remote Procedure Call (RPC).</para>

        <listitem>
            <para>nova-volume - The nova-volume service is responsible for managing attachable block

            <para>nova-network - The nova-network service is responsible for managing floating and
                fixed IPs, DHCP, bridging and VLANs. It loads a Service object which exposes the
                public methods on one of the subclasses of NetworkManager. Different networking
                strategies are available to the service by changing the network_manager configuration option to
                FlatManager, FlatDHCPManager, or VlanManager (default is VLAN if no other is
                specified).</para>

        <para>These basic categories describe the service architecture and what's going on within the cloud controller.</para>
        <simplesect><title>API Server</title>

            <para>At the heart of the cloud framework is an API Server. This API Server makes command and control of the hypervisor, storage, and networking programmatically available to users in realization of the definition of cloud computing.
            </para>
            <para>The API endpoints are basic http web services which handle authentication, authorization, and basic command and control functions using various API interfaces under the Amazon, Rackspace, and related models. This enables API compatibility with multiple existing tool sets created for interaction with offerings from other vendors. This broad compatibility prevents vendor lock-in.
            </para> </simplesect>
        <simplesect><title>Message Queue</title>
            <para>
            A messaging queue brokers the interaction between compute nodes (processing), volumes (block storage), the networking controllers (software which controls network infrastructure), API endpoints, the scheduler (determines which physical hardware to allocate to a virtual resource), and similar components. Communication to and from the cloud controller is by HTTP requests through multiple API endpoints.</para>

<para>            A typical message passing event begins with the API server receiving a request from a user. The API server authenticates the user and ensures that the user is permitted to issue the subject command. Availability of objects implicated in the request is evaluated and, if available, the request is routed to the queuing engine for the relevant workers. Workers continually listen to the queue based on their role, and occasionally their type hostname. When such listening produces a work request, the worker takes assignment of the task and begins its execution. Upon completion, a response is dispatched to the queue which is received by the API server and relayed to the originating user. Database entries are queried, added, or removed as necessary throughout the process.

        <title>Managing Volumes</title>
        <para>Nova-volume is the service that allows you to give extra block level storage to your
            OpenStack Compute instances. You may recognize this as a similar offering from Amazon
            EC2 known as Elastic Block Storage (EBS). However, nova-volume is not the same
            implementation that EC2 uses today. Nova-volume is an iSCSI solution that employs the
            use of Logical Volume Manager (LVM) for Linux. Note that a volume may only be attached
            to one instance at a time. This is not a ‘shared storage’ solution like a SAN of NFS on
            which multiple servers can attach to.</para>

                    <para>In order to backup our volume, we first need
                        to create a snapshot of it. An LVM snapshot is
                        the exact copy of a logical volume, which
                        contains data in a frozen state. This prevents
                        data corruption, because data will not be
                        manipulated during the process of creating the
                        volume itself. Remember the volumes
                        created through a

                    <para>Before creating the
                            snapshot, ensure that you have enough
                            space to save it. As a precaution, you
                            should have at least twice as much space
                            as the potential snapshot size. If
                            insufficient space is available, there is
                            a risk that the snapshot could become
                            corrupted.</para>

            <para>NexentaStor Appliance is NAS/SAN software platform designed for building reliable and fast network storage arrays. The NexentaStor is based on
                the OpenSolaris and uses ZFS as a disk management system. NexentaStor can serve as a storage node for the OpenStack and provide block-level volumes
                for the virtual servers via iSCSI protocol. </para>
            <para>The Nexenta driver allows you to use Nexenta SA to

                every new volume the driver creates a iSCSI target and

                                backups are possible. A flavor can be

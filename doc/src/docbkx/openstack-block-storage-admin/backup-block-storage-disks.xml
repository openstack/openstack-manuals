            <para>While you can use the snapshot functionality (using
        LVM snapshot), you can also back up your volumes. The
        advantage of this method is that it reduces the size of the
        backup; only existing data will be backed up, instead of the
        entire volume. For this example, assume that a 100 GB volume
        has been created for an instance, while only 4 gigabytes are
        used. This process will back up only those 4 gigabytes, with
        the following tools: </para>

                    <para>In order to backup our volume, we first need
                        to create a snapshot of it. An LVM snapshot is
                        the exact copy of a logical volume, which
                        contains data in a frozen state. This prevents
                        data corruption, because data will not be
                        manipulated during the process of creating the
                        volume itself. Remember the volumes
                        created through a
                            <command>nova volume-create</command>
                        exist in an LVM's logical volume. </para>
                    <para>Before creating the
                            snapshot, ensure that you have enough
                            space to save it. As a precaution, you
                            should have at least twice as much space
                            as the potential snapshot size. If
                            insufficient space is available, there is
                            a risk that the snapshot could become
                            corrupted.</para>
                    <para>Use the following command to obtain a list
                        of all
                        volumes.<screen>
<prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>lvdisplay</userinput>
                        </screen>In
                        this example, we will refer to a volume called
                            <literal>volume-00000001</literal>, which
                        is a 10GB volume. This process can be applied
                        to all volumes, not matter their size. At the
                        end of the section, we will present a script
                        that you could use to create scheduled
                        backups. The script itself exploits what we
                        discuss here. </para>
                    <para>First, create the snapshot; this can be
                        achieved while the volume is attached to an
                        instance :</para>

                    <para>We indicate to LVM we want a snapshot of an
                        already existing volume with the
                            <literal>--snapshot</literal>
                        configuration option. The command includes the
                        size of the space reserved for the snapshot
                        volume, the name of the snapshot, and the path
                        of an already existing volume (In most cases,
                        the path will be

                    <para>The size doesn't have to be the same as the
                        volume of the snapshot. The size parameter
                        designates the space that LVM will reserve for
                        the snapshot volume. As a precaution, the size
                        should be the same as that of the original
                        volume, even if we know the whole space is not
                        currently used by the snapshot. </para>

            </para>
            <para>Because you can expect that more and more volumes
                will be allocated to your Block Storage service, you may
                want to automate your backups. This script <link
                    xlink:href="https://github.com/Razique/BashStuff/blob/master/SYSTEMS/OpenStack/SCR_5005_V01_NUAC-OPENSTACK-EBS-volumes-backup.sh"
                    >here</link> will assist you on this task. The
                script performs the operations from the previous
                example, but also provides a mail report and runs the
                backup based on the
                    <literal>backups_retention_days</literal> setting.
                It is meant to be launched from the server which runs
                the Block Storage component.</para>
            <para>Here is an example of a mail report: </para>

            <para>The script also provides the ability to SSH to your
                instances and run a mysqldump into them. In order to
                make this to work, ensure the connection via the
                nova's project keys is enabled. If you don't want to
                run the mysqldumps, you can turn off this
                functionality by adding
                    <literal>enable_mysql_dump=0</literal> to the
                script.</para>

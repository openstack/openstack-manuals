    <para>Storage is found in many parts of the OpenStack stack, and
        the differing types can cause confusion to even experienced
        cloud engineers. This section focuses on persistent storage
        options you can configure with your cloud.</para>

        <para>If you only deploy the OpenStack Compute Service (nova),
            your users do not have access to any form of persistent
            storage by default. The disks associated with VMs are
            "ephemeral", meaning that (from the user's point of view)
            they effectively disappear when a virtual machine is
            terminated. You must identify what type of persistent
            storage you want to support for your users.</para>
        <para>Today, OpenStack clouds explicitly support two types of
            persistent storage: <emphasis>object storage</emphasis>
            and <emphasis>block storage</emphasis>.</para>
        <section xml:id="object_storage">
            <title>Object Storage</title>
            <para>With object storage, users access binary objects
                through a REST API. You may be familiar with Amazon
                S3, which is a well-known example of an object storage
                system. If your intended users need to archive or
                manage large datasets, you want to provide them with
                object storage. In addition, OpenStack can store your
                virtual machine (VM) images inside of an object
                storage system, as an alternative to storing the
                images on a file system.</para>
        </section>
        <?hard-pagebreak?>
        <section xml:id="block_storage">
            <title>Block Storage</title>
            <para>Block storage (sometimes referred to as volume
                storage) exposes a block device to the user. Users
                interact with block storage by attaching volumes to
                their running virtual machine instances. These volumes
                are persistent: they can be detached from one instance
                and re-attached to another, and the data remains
                intact. Block storage is implemented in OpenStack by
                the OpenStack Block Storage (Cinder) project, which
                supports multiple back-ends in the form of drivers.
                Your choice of a storage back-end must be supported by
                a Block Storage driver.</para>
        </section>
        <section xml:id="file_level_storage">
            <title>File-level Storage</title>
            <para>With file-level storage, users access stored data
                using the operating system's file system interface.
                Most users, if they have used a network storage
                solution before, have encountered this form of
                networked storage. In the Unix world, the most common
                form of this is NFS. In the Windows world, the most
                common form is called CIFS (previously, SMB).
                OpenStack clouds do not present file-level storage to
                end users. However, it is important to consider
                file-level storage for storing instances under
                    <code>/var/lib/nova/instances</code> when
                designing your cloud, since you must have a shared
                file system if you wish to support live
                migration.</para>

        <title>Notes on OpenStack Object Storage</title>
        <para>OpenStack Object Storage provides a highly scalable,
            highly available storage solution by relaxing some of the
            constraints of traditional file systems. In designing and
            procuring for such a cluster, it is important to
            understand some key concepts about its operation.
            Essentially, this type of storage is built on the idea
            that all storage hardware fails, at every level, at some
            point. Infrequently encountered failures that would
            hamstring other storage systems, such as issues taking
            down RAID cards, or entire servers are handled gracefully
            with OpenStack Object Storage.</para>
        <para>A good document describing the Object Storage
            architecture is found within <link

            (http://docs.openstack.org/developer/swift/overview_architecture.html)
            - read this first. Once you have understood the
            architecture, you should know what a proxy server does and
            how zones work. However, some there important points that
            are often missed at first glance.</para>
        <para>When designing your cluster, you must consider
            durability and availability. Understand that the
            predominant source of these is the spread and placement of
            your data, rather than the reliability of the hardware.
            Consider the default value of the number of replicas,
            which is 3. This means that when before an object is
            marked as having being written at least two copies exists
            - in case a single server fails to write, the third copy
            may or may not yet exist when the write operation
            initially returns. Altering this number increases the
            robustness of your data, but reduces the amount of storage
            you have available. Next look at the placement of your
            servers. Consider spreading them widely throughout your
            data centre's network and power failure zones. Is a zone a
            rack, a server or a disk?</para>
        <para>Object Storage's network patterns might seem unfamiliar
            at first. </para>

        <para>Object Storage is very 'chatty' among servers hosting
            data - even a small cluster does megabytes/second of
            traffic, which is predominantly "Do you have the
            object?"/"Yes I have the object!." Of course, if the
            answer to the aforementioned question is negative or times
            out, replication of the object begins. </para>
        <para>Consider the scenario where an entire server fails, and
            24 TB of data needs to be transferred "immediately" to
            remain at three copies - this can put significant load on
            the network.</para>
        <para>Another oft forgotten fact is that when a new file is
            being uploaded, the proxy server must write out as many
            streams as there are replicas - giving a multiple of
            network traffic. For a 3-replica cluster, 10Gbps in means
            30Gbps out. Combining this with the previous high
            bandwidth demands of replication is what results in the
            recommendation that your private network is of
            significantly higher bandwidth than your public need be.
            Oh, and OpenStack Object Storage communicates internally
            with unencrypted, unauthenticated rsync for performance -
            you do want the private network to be private.</para>
        <para>The remaining point on bandwidth is the public facing
            portion. swift-proxy is stateless, which means that you
            can easily add more and use http load-balancing methods to
            share bandwidth and availability between them. </para>
        <para>More proxies means more bandwidth, if your storage can
            keep up.</para>

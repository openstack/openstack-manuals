    <title>Network Design</title>
    <para>OpenStack provides a rich networking environment, and this
        chapter details the requirements and options to deliberate
        when designing your cloud.</para>
    <para>If this is the first time you are deploying a cloud
        infrastructure in your organisation, after reading this
        section, your first conversations should be with your
        networking team. Network usage in a running cloud is vastly
        different from traditional network deployments, and has the
        potential to be disruptive at both a connectivity and a policy
        level.</para>
    <para>For example, you must plan the number of IP addresses that
        you need for both your guest instances as well as management
        infrastructure. Additionally, you must research and discuss
        cloud network connectivity through proxy servers and
        firewalls.</para>
    <section xml:id="mgmt_network">
        <title>Management Network</title>
        <para>A management network, typically consisting of a separate
            switch and separate NICs, is a recommended option. This
            segregation prevents system administration and monitoring
            system access from being disrupted by traffic generated by
            the guests themselves.</para>
        <para>Consider creating other private networks for
            communication between internal components of OpenStack,
            such as the Message Queue and OpenStack Compute. VLANs are
            great for these scenarios.</para>
    </section>
    <section xml:id="public_addressing">
        <title>Public Addressing Options</title>
        <para>There are two main types of IP addresses for guest
            virtual machines: Fixed IPs and Floating IPs. Fixed IPs
            are assigned to instances on boot, whereas Floating IP
            addresses can change their association between instances
            by action of the user. Both types of IP addresses can
            either be public or private, depending on your use
            case.</para>
        <para>Fixed IP addresses are required, whereas it is possible
            to run OpenStack without Floating IPs. One of the most
            common use cases for Floating IPs is to provide public IP
            addresses to a private cloud, where there are a limited
            number of IP addresses available. Another is for a public
            cloud user to have a "static" IP address that can be
            reassigned when an instance is upgraded or moved.</para>
        <para>Fixed IP addresses can be private for private clouds, or
            public for public clouds. When an instance terminates, its
            Fixed IP is lost. It is worth noting that newer users of
            cloud computing may find their ephemeral nature
            frustrating.</para>
    </section>
    <section xml:id="ip_address_planning">
        <title>IP Address Planning</title>
        <para>An OpenStack installation can potentially have many
            subnets, and different types of services in each. An IP
            address plan can assist with a shared understanding of
            network partition purposes and scalability. Control
            services can have public and private IP addresses, and as
            noted above there are a couple of options for instance's
            public addresses.</para>
        <para>An IP address plan might be broken down into the
            following sections:</para>

        <para>A similar approach can be taken with public IP
            addresses, taking note that large, flat ranges are
            preferred for use with guest instance IPs. Take into
            account that for some OpenStack networking options, a
            public IP address in the range of a guest instance public
            IP address is assigned to the nova-compute host.</para>

            <para>VLAN configuration can be as simple or as
                complicated as desired. The use of VLANs has the
                benefit of allowing each project its own subnet and
                broadcast segregation from other projects. to
                allow OpenStack to efficiently use VLANs, you must
                allocate a VLAN range (one for each project) and turn
                each compute node switch port into a trunk
                port.</para>
            <para>For example, if you estimate that your cloud must
                support a max of 100 projects, pick a free VLAN range
                that your network infrastructure is currently not
                using (such as, VLAN 200 - 299). You must configure
                OpenStack with this range as well as configure your
                switch ports to allow VLAN traffic from that
                range.</para>

        <section xml:id="multi_host_single_host_networks">
            <title>Multi-host and Single-host Networking</title>
            <para>The nova-network service has the ability to operate
                in a multi-host or single-host mode. Multi-host is
                when each compute node runs a copy of nova-network and
                the instances on that compute node use the compute
                node as a gateway to the Internet. The compute nodes
                also host the Floating IPs and Security Groups for
                instances on that node. Single-host is when a central
                server, for example, the cloud controller, runs the
                    <code>nova-network</code> service. All compute
                nodes forward traffic from the instances to the cloud
                controller. The cloud controller then forwards traffic
                to the Internet. The cloud controller hosts the
                Floating IPs and Security Groups for all instances on
                all compute nodes in the cloud.</para>
            <para>There are benefits to both modes. Single-node has
                the downside of a single point of failure. If the
                cloud controller is not available, instances cannot
                communicate on the network. This is not true with
                multi-host, but multi-host requires that each compute
                node has a public IP address to communicate
                on the Internet. If you are not able to obtain a
                significant block of public IP addresses, multi-host
                might not be an option.</para>

        <title>Double VLAN</title>
        <para>I was on-site in Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada
            setting up a new OpenStack cloud. The deployment was fully
            automated: Cobbler deployed the OS on the bare metal,
            bootstrapped it, and Puppet took over from there. I had
            run the deployment scenario so many times in practice and
            took for granted that everything was working. </para>
        <para>On my last day in Kelowna, I was in a conference call
            from my hotel. In the background, I was fooling around on
            the new cloud. I launched an instance and logged in.
            Everything looked fine. Out of boredom, I ran ps aux and
            all of the sudden the instance locked up. </para>
        <para>Thinking it was just a one-off issue, I terminated the
            instance and launched a new one. By then, the conference
            call ended and I was off to the data center. </para>
        <para>At the data center, I was finishing up some tasks and
            remembered the lock-up. I logged into the new instance and
            ran ps aux again. It worked. Phew. I decided to run it one
            more time. It locked up. WTF.</para>
        <para> After reproducing the problem several times, I came to
            the unfortunate conclusion that this cloud did indeed have
            a problem. Even worse, my time was up in Kelowna and I had
            to return back to Calgary.</para>
        <para> Where do you even begin troubleshooting something like
            this? An instance just randomly locks when a command is
            issued. Is it the image? Nope — it happens on all images.
            Is it the compute node? Nope — all nodes. Is the instance
            locked up? No! New SSH connections work just fine! </para>
        <para>We reached out for help. A networking engineer suggested
            it was an MTU issue. Great! MTU! Something to go on!
            What's MTU and why would it cause a problem? </para>
        <para>MTU is maximum transmission unit. It specifies the
            maximum number of bytes that the interface accepts for each
            packet. If two interfaces have two different MTUs, bytes might get chopped off and weird
            things happen -- such as random session lockups. It's
            important to note that not all packets will have a size of
            1500. Running the ls command over SSH might only create a
            single packets less than 1500 bytes. However, running a
            command with heavy output, such as <command>ps
                aux</command> requires several packets of 1500
            bytes. </para>
        <para>OK, so where is the MTU issue coming from? Why haven't
            we seen this in any other deployment? What's new in this
            situation? Well, new data center, new uplink, new
            switches, new model of switches, new servers, first time
            using this model of servers… so, basically everything was
            new. Wonderful. We toyed around with raising the MTU at
            various areas: the switches, the NICs on the compute
            nodes, the virtual NICs in the instances, we even had the
            data center raise the MTU for our uplink interface. Some
            changes worked, some didn't. This line of troubleshooting
            didn't feel right, though. We shouldn't have to be
            changing the MTU in these areas. </para>
        <para>As a last resort, our network admin (Alvaro) and myself
            sat down with four terminal windows, a pencil, and a piece
            of paper. In one window, we ran ping. In the second
            window, we ran tcpdump on the cloud controller. In the
            third, tcpdump on the compute node. And the forth had
            tcpdump on the instance. For background, this cloud was a
            multi-node, non-multi-host setup. </para>
        <para>There was one cloud controller that acted as a gateway
            to all compute nodes. VlanManager was used for the network
            config. This means that the cloud controller and all
            compute nodes had a different VLAN for each OpenStack
            project. We used the -s option of ping to change the
            packet size. We watched as sometimes packets would fully
            return, sometimes they'd only make it out and never back
            in, and sometimes the packets would stop at a random
            point. We changed tcpdump to start displaying the hex dump
            of the packet. We pinged between every combination of
            outside, controller, compute, and instance. </para>
        <para>Finally, Alvaro noticed something. When a packet from
            the outside hits the cloud controller, it should not be
            configured with a VLAN. We verified this as true. When the
            packet went from the cloud controller to the compute node,
            it should only have a VLAN if it was destined for an
            instance. This was still true. When the ping reply was
            sent from the instance, it should be in a VLAN. True. When
            it came back to the cloud controller and on its way out to
            the public internet, it should no longer have a VLAN.
            False. Uh oh. It looked as though the VLAN part of the
            packet was not being removed. </para>
        <para>That made no sense. </para>
        <para>While bouncing this idea around in our heads, I was
            randomly typing commands on the compute node: </para>
        <programlisting><prompt>$</prompt> ip a
&hellip;
10: vlan100@vlan20: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue master br100 state UP
&hellip;</programlisting>
        <para>"Hey Alvaro, can you run a VLAN on top of a
            VLAN?"</para>
        <para>"If you did, you'd add an extra 4 bytes to the
            packet&hellip;"</para>
        <para>Then it all made sense…</para>
        <programlisting>$ grep vlan_interface /etc/nova/nova.conf
vlan_interface=vlan20</programlisting>
        <para>In <code>nova.conf</code>, <code>vlan_interface</code>
            specifies what interface OpenStack should attach all VLANs
            to. The correct setting should have been:</para>
        <programlisting>vlan_interface=bond0</programlisting>
        <para>As this would be the server's bonded NIC.</para>
        <para>vlan20 is the VLAN that the data center gave us for
            outgoing public internet access. It's a correct VLAN and
            is also attached to bond0. </para>
        <para>By mistake, I configured OpenStack to attach all tenant
            VLANs to vlan20 instead of bond0 thereby stacking one VLAN
            on top of another which then added an extra 4 bytes to
            each packet which cause a packet of 1504 bytes to be sent
            out which would cause problems when it arrived at an
            interface that only accepted 1500!</para>
        <para>As soon as this setting was fixed, everything
            worked.</para>

    <chapter xml:id="the_issue">
        <title>"The Issue"</title>
        <para>At the end of August 2012, a post-secondary school in
            Alberta, Canada migrated its infrastructure to an
            OpenStack cloud. As luck would have it, within the first
            day or two of it running, one of their servers just
            disappeared from the network. Blip. Gone.</para>
        <para>After restarting the instance, everything was back up
            and running. We reviewed the logs and saw that at some
            point, network communication stopped and then everything
            went idle. We chalked this up to a random
            occurrence.</para>
        <para>A few nights later, it happened again.</para>
        <para>We reviewed both sets of logs. The one thing that stood
            out the most was DHCP. OpenStack, by default, sets DHCP
            leases for one minute. This means that every instance 
            contacts the cloud controller (DHCP server) to renew its
            fixed IP. For some reason, this instance could not renew
            its IP. We correlated the instance's logs with the logs on
            the cloud controller and put together a
            conversation:</para>

            <listitem>

                <para>Cloud controller receives the renewal request

                <para>Instance "ignores" the response and re-sends the

            <listitem>
                <para>Cloud controller receives the second request and
                    sends a new response.</para>

                        <code>255.255.255.255</code> since it hasn't
                    heard back from the cloud controller.</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>The cloud controller receives the
                        <code>255.255.255.255</code> request and sends
                    a third response.</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>The instance finally gives up.</para>
            </listitem>
        </orderedlist>
        <para>With this information in hand, we were sure that the
            problem had to do with DHCP. We thought that for some
            reason, the instance wasn't getting a new IP address and
            with no IP, it shut itself off from the network.</para>
        <para>A quick Google search turned up this: <link
                xlink:title="DAIR project"
                xlink:href="https://lists.launchpad.net/openstack/msg11696.html"
                >DHCP lease errors in VLAN mode</link>
            (https://lists.launchpad.net/openstack/msg11696.html)
            which further supported our DHCP theory.</para>
        <para>An initial idea was to just increase the lease time. If
            the instance only renewed once every week, the chances of
            this problem happening would be tremendously smaller than
            every minute. This didn't solve the problem, though. It
            was just covering the problem up.</para>
        <para>We decided to have <code>tcpdump</code> run on this
            instance and see if we could catch it in action again.
            Sure enough, we did.</para>
        <para>The <code>tcpdump</code> looked very, very weird. In
            short, it looked as though network communication stopped
            before the instance tried to renew its IP. Since there is
            so much DHCP chatter from a one minute lease, it's very
            hard to confirm it, but even with only milliseconds
            difference between packets, if one packet arrives first,
            it arrived first, and if that packet reported network
            issues, then it had to have happened before DHCP.</para>
        <para>Additionally, this instance in question was responsible
            for a very, very large backup job each night. While "The
            Issue" (as we were now calling it) didn't happen exactly
            when the backup happened, it was close enough (a few
            hours) that we couldn't ignore it.</para>
        <para>Further days go by and we catch The Issue in action more
            and more. We find that dhclient is not running after The
            Issue happens. Now we're back to thinking it's a DHCP
            issue. Running <code>/etc/init.d/networking</code> restart
            brings everything back up and running.</para>
        <para>Ever have one of those days where all of the sudden you
            get the Google results you were looking for? Well, that's
            what happened here. I was looking for information on
            dhclient and why it dies when it can't renew its lease and
            all of the sudden I found a bunch of OpenStack and dnsmasq
            discussions that were identical to the problem we were
            seeing!</para>

        <para>It was funny to read the report. It was full of people

            minutes, the instance just disappeared from the
            network.</para>
        <para>Armed with a patched qemu and a way to reproduce, we set

        <title>Disappearing Images</title>
        <para>At the end of 2012, Cybera (a nonprofit with a mandate
            to oversee the development of cyberinfrastructure in
            Alberta, Canada) deployed an updated OpenStack cloud for
            their <link xlink:title="DAIR project"
                xlink:href="http://www.canarie.ca/en/dair-program/about"
                >DAIR project</link>
            (http://www.canarie.ca/en/dair-program/about). A few days
            into production, a compute node locks up. Upon rebooting
            the node, I checked to see what instances were hosted on
            that node so I could boot them on behalf of the customer.
            Luckily, only one instance.</para>
        <para>The <code>nova reboot</code> command wasn't working, so
            I used <code>virsh</code>, but it immediately came back
            with an error saying it was unable to find the backing
            disk. In this case, the backing disk is the Glance image
            that is copied to
                <code>/var/lib/nova/instances/_base</code> when the
            image is used for the first time. Why couldn't it find it?
            I checked the directory and sure enough it was
            gone.</para>
        <para>I reviewed the <code>nova</code> database and saw the
            instance's entry in the <code>nova.instances</code> table.
            The image that the instance was using matched what virsh
            was reporting, so no inconsistency there.</para>
        <para>I checked Glance and noticed that this image was a
            snapshot that the user created. At least that was good
            news — this user would have been the only user
            affected.</para>
        <para>Finally, I checked StackTach and reviewed the user's
            events. They had created and deleted several snapshots
            — most likely experimenting. Although the timestamps
            didn't match up, my conclusion was that they launched
            their instance and then deleted the snapshot and it was
            somehow removed from
                <code>/var/lib/nova/instances/_base</code>. None of
            that made sense, but it was the best I could come up
            with.</para>
        <para>It turns out the reason that this compute node locked up
            was a hardware issue. We removed it from the DAIR cloud
            and called Dell to have it serviced. Dell arrived and
            began working. Somehow or another (or a fat finger), a
            different compute node was bumped and rebooted.
            Great.</para>
        <para>When this node fully booted, I ran through the same
            scenario of seeing what instances were running so I could
            turn them back on. There were a total of four. Three
            booted and one gave an error. It was the same error as
            before: unable to find the backing disk. Seriously,
            what?</para>
        <para>Again, it turns out that the image was a snapshot. The
            three other instances that successfully started were
            standard cloud images. Was it a problem with snapshots?
            That didn't make sense.</para>
        <para>A note about DAIR's architecture:
                <code>/var/lib/nova/instances</code> is a shared NFS
            mount. This means that all compute nodes have access to
            it, which includes the <code>_base</code> directory.
            Another centralized area is <code>/var/log/rsyslog</code>
            on the cloud controller. This directory collects all
            OpenStack logs from all compute nodes. I wondered if there
            were any entries for the file that <code>virsh</code> is
            reporting:</para>
        <para>
            <code>dair-ua-c03/nova.log:Dec 19 12:10:59 dair-ua-c03
                2012-12-19 12:10:59 INFO nova.virt.libvirt.imagecache

                /var/lib/nova/instances/_base/7b4783508212f5d242cbf9ff56fb8d33b4ce6166_10</code>
        </para>
        <para>Ah-hah! So OpenStack was deleting it. But why?</para>
        <para>A feature was introduced in Essex to periodically check
            and see if there were any _base files not in use. If there
            were, Nova would delete them. This idea sounds innocent
            enough and has some good qualities to it. But how did this
            feature end up turned on? It was disabled by default in

            (https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1029674). I cannot
            emphasize enough that:</para>

            <emphasis>Actions which delete things should not be

        <para>Disk space is cheap these days. Data recovery is
            not.</para>
        <para>Secondly, DAIR's shared
                <code>/var/lib/nova/instances</code> directory
            contributed to the problem. Since all compute nodes have
            access to this directory, all compute nodes periodically
            review the _base directory. If there is only one instance
            using an image, and the node that the instance is on is
            down for a few minutes, it won't be able to mark the image
            as still in use. Therefore, the image seems like it's not
            in use and is deleted. When the compute node comes back
            online, the instance hosted on that node is unable to
            start.</para>

        <title>The Valentine's Day Compute Node Massacre</title>
        <para>Although the title of this story is much more dramatic
            than the actual event, I don't think, or hope, that I'll
            have the opportunity to use "Valentine's Day Massacre"
            again in a title.</para>
        <para>This past Valentine's Day, I received an alert that a
            compute node was no longer available in the cloud
            — meaning,</para>
        <programlisting>nova-manage service list</programlisting>
        <para>showed this particular node with a status of
                <code>XXX</code>.</para>
        <para>I logged into the cloud controller and was able to both
            ping and SSH into the problematic compute node which
            seemed very odd. Usually if I receive this type of alert,
            the compute node has totally locked up and would be
            inaccessible.</para>
        <para>After a few minutes of troubleshooting, I saw the
            following details:</para>
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>A user recently tried launching a CentOS
                    instance on that node</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>This user was the only user on the node (new
                    node)</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>The load shot up to 8 right before I received
                    the alert</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>The bonded 10gb network device (bond0) was in a
                    DOWN state</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>The 1gb NIC was still alive and active</para>
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para>I looked at the status of both NICs in the bonded pair
            and saw that neither was able to communicate with the
            switch port. Seeing as how each NIC in the bond is
            connected to a separate switch, I thought that the chance
            of a switch port dying on each switch at the same time was
            quite improbable. I concluded that the 10gb dual port NIC
            had died and needed replaced. I created a ticket for the
            hardware support department at the data center where the
            node was hosted. I felt lucky that this was a new node and
            no one else was hosted on it yet.</para>
        <para>An hour later I received the same alert, but for another
            compute node. Crap. OK, now there's definitely a problem
            going on. Just like the original node, I was able to log
            in by SSH. The bond0 NIC was DOWN but the 1gb NIC was
            active.</para>
        <para>And the best part: the same user had just tried creating
            a CentOS instance. Wat?</para>
        <para>I was totally confused at this point, so I texted our
            network admin to see if he was available to help. He
            logged in to both switches and immediately saw the
            problem: the switches detected spanning tree packets
            coming from the two compute nodes and immediately shut the
            ports down to prevent spanning tree loops:</para>
        <programlisting>Feb 15 01:40:18 SW-1 Stp: %SPANTREE-4-BLOCK_BPDUGUARD: Received BPDU packet on Port-Channel35 with BPDU guard enabled. Disabling interface. (source mac fa:16:3e:24:e7:22)

Feb 15 01:40:19 SW-1 Ebra: %LINEPROTO-5-UPDOWN: Line protocol on Interface Ethernet35 (Server35), changed state to down</programlisting>
        <para>He re-enabled the switch ports and the two compute nodes
            immediately came back to life.</para>
        <para>Unfortunately, this story has an open ending... we're
            still looking into why the CentOS image was sending out
            spanning tree packets. Further, we're researching a proper
            way on how to mitigate this from happening. It's a bigger
            issue than one might think. While it's extremely important
            for switches to prevent spanning tree loops, it's very
            problematic to have an entire compute node be cut from the
            network when this happens. If a compute node is hosting
            100 instances and one of them sends a spanning tree
            packet, that instance has effectively DDOS'd the other 99
            instances.</para>
        <para>This is an ongoing and hot topic in networking circles
            — especially with the raise of virtualization and virtual
            switches.</para>

        <title>Down the Rabbit Hole</title>
        <para>Users being able to retrieve console logs from running
            instances is a boon for support — many times they can
            figure out what's going on inside their instance and fix
            what's going on without bothering you. Unfortunately,
            sometimes overzealous logging of failures can cause
            problems of its own.</para>
        <para>A report came in: VMs were launching slowly, or not at
            all. Cue the standard checks — nothing on the nagios, but
            there was a spike in network towards the current master of
            our RabbitMQ cluster. Investigation started, but soon the
            other parts of the queue cluster were leaking memory like
            a sieve. Then the alert came in — the master rabbit server
            went down. Connections failed over to the slave.</para>
        <para>At that time, our control services were hosted by
            another team and we didn't have much debugging information
            to determine what was going on with the master, and
            couldn't reboot it. That team noted that it failed without
            alert, but managed to reboot it. After an hour, the
            cluster had returned to its normal state and we went home
            for the day.</para>
        <para>Continuing the diagnosis the next morning was kick
            started by another identical failure. We quickly got the
            message queue running again, and tried to work out why
            Rabbit was suffering from so much network traffic.
            Enabling debug logging on nova-api quickly brought
            understanding. A <code>tail -f
                /var/log/nova/nova-api.log</code> was scrolling by
            faster than we'd ever seen before. CTRL+C on that and we
            could plainly see the contents of a system log spewing
            failures over and over again - a system log from one of
            our users' instances.</para>
        <para>After finding the instance ID we headed over to
                <code>/var/lib/nova/instances</code> to find the
                <code>console.log</code>:</para>
        <programlisting>adm@cc12:/var/lib/nova/instances/instance-00000e05# wc -l console.log
      92890453 console.log
      adm@cc12:/var/lib/nova/instances/instance-00000e05# ls -sh console.log
      5.5G console.log</programlisting>
        <para>Sure enough, the user had been periodically refreshing
            the console log page on the dashboard and the 5G file was
            traversing the rabbit cluster to get to the
            dashboard.</para>
        <para>We called them and asked them to stop for a while, and
            they were happy to abandon the horribly broken VM. After
            that, we started monitoring the size of console
            logs.</para>
        <para>To this day, <link

                >the issue</link>
            (https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/832507) doesn't have
            a permanent resolution, but we look forward to the
            discussion at the next summit.</para>

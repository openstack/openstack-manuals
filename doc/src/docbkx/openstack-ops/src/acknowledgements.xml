    <para>The OpenStack Foundation supported the creation of this
        book with plane tickets to Austin, lodging (including one
        adventurous evening without power after a windstorm), and
        delicious food. For about USD $10,000, we could
        collaborate intensively for a week in the same room at the
        Rackspace Austin office. The authors are all members of
        the OpenStack Foundation, which you can join. Go to the

                <para>Emma Richards of Rackspace Guest Relations
                    took excellent care of our lunch orders and
                    even set aside a pile of sticky notes that had
                    fallen off the walls. </para>

                <para>The Real Estate team at Rackspace in Austin,

    <para>We couldn't have pulled it off without so much
        supportive help and encouragement.</para>

            from a Friday inquiry email (you want to do what by when?)
            to a Friday delivery email, including source files and
            open source fonts.</phrase> -->

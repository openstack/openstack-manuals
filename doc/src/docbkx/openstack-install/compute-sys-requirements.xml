        components are intended to run on standard hardware.
        Recommended hardware configurations for a minimum
        production deployment are as follows for the cloud
        controller nodes and compute nodes for Compute and the
        Image Service, and object, account, container, and proxy
        servers for Object Storage. </para>

                    <para>With 2 GB RAM you can run one m1.small instance on a node or three
                        m1.tiny instances without memory swapping, so 2 GB RAM would be a
                        minimum for a test-environment compute node. As an example, Rackspace
                        Cloud Builders use 96 GB RAM for compute nodes in OpenStack
                        deployments.</para>

                        with SVM extensions (also called AMD-V) or an Intel processor with VT
                        (virtualization technology) extensions. </para>

        <para>While certain parts of OpenStack are known to work on
            various operating systems, currently the only

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Operating System</emphasis>: OpenStack
        currently has packages for the following distributions:
        CentOS, Debian, Fedora, RHEL, openSUSE, SLES, and Ubuntu. These packages are
        maintained by community members, refer to <link
            xlink:href="http://wiki.openstack.org/Packaging"
            >http://wiki.openstack.org/Packaging</link> for additional

            <para os="ubuntu">The Grizzly version is available on the
                most recent LTS (Long Term Support) version which is
                12.04 (Precise Pangolin), via the Ubuntu Cloud
                Archive. At this time, there are not
                packages available for 12.10. It is also available on
                the current Ubuntu development series, which is 13.04
                (Raring Ringtail). </para>

                requires Fedora 16 or later.</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Database</emphasis>: For
        OpenStack Compute, you need access to either a PostgreSQL
        or MySQL database, or you can install it as part of the
        OpenStack Compute installation process.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Permissions</emphasis>: You can
        install OpenStack services either as root or as a user
        with sudo permissions if you configure the sudoers file
         to enable all the permissions. </para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Network Time Protocol</emphasis>:
        You must install a time synchronization program such as
        NTP. For Compute, time synchronization avoids problems
        when scheduling VM launches on compute
        nodes. For Object Storage, time synchronization ensure the
        object replications are accurately updating objects when
        needed so that the freshest content is served.</para>

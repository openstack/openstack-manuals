   OpenStackClient is a command-line client for OpenStack that brings
   the command set for the various APIs together in a single shell
   with a uniform command structure.

   Presently,
   Data Processing service (sahara),
   Identity service (keystone),
   and Messaging service (zaqar)
   only use the OpenStackClient command set.

   For more information about OpenStackClient and the command list,
   see the `OpenStackClient documentation
   <https://docs.openstack.org/developer/python-openstackclient/>`_.

        <para>The OpenStack Networking service, code-named neutron,
            provides an API for defining network connectivity and
            addressing in the cloud. The OpenStack Networking service
            enables operators to leverage different networking
            technologies to power their cloud networking.</para>
        <para>The OpenStack Networking service also provides an API to
            configure and manage a variety of network services ranging
            from L3 forwarding and NAT to load balancing, edge
            firewalls, and IPSEC VPN.</para>

            <para>Networking is a virtual network service that
                provides a powerful API to define the network
                connectivity and IP addressing used by devices from
                other services, such as OpenStack Compute.</para>
            <para>The Compute API has a virtual server abstraction to
                describe computing resources. Similarly, the OpenStack
                Networking API has virtual network, subnet, and port
                abstractions to describe networking resources. In more

            <para>You can configure rich network topologies by
                creating and configuring networks and subnets, and
                then instructing other OpenStack services like
                OpenStack Compute to attach virtual devices to ports
                on these networks. In particular, OpenStack Networking
                supports each tenant having multiple private networks,
                and allows tenants to choose their own IP addressing
                scheme (even if those IP addresses overlap with those

            <para>Enhancing traditional networking solutions to
                provide rich cloud networking is challenging.
                Traditional networking is not designed to scale to
                cloud proportions nor to handle automatic
                configuration.</para>
            <para>The original OpenStack Compute network
                implementation assumed a very basic model of
                performing all isolation through Linux VLANs and IP
                tables. OpenStack Networking introduces the concept of
                a <emphasis role="italic">plug-in</emphasis>, which is
                a back-end implementation of the OpenStack Networking
                API. A plug-in can use a variety of technologies to
                implement the logical API requests. Some OpenStack
                Networking plug-ins might use basic Linux VLANs and IP
                tables, while others might use more advanced
                technologies, such as L2-in-L3 tunneling or OpenFlow,
                to provide similar benefits.</para>

        <para>Before you deploy Networking, it helps to understand the
            Networking components and how these components interact

            <title>Overview</title>

            <para>OpenStack Networking is a standalone service, just
                like other OpenStack services such as OpenStack
                Compute, OpenStack Image service, OpenStack Identity
                service, or the OpenStack Dashboard. Like those
                services, a deployment of OpenStack Networking often
                involves deploying several processes on a variety of
                hosts.</para>
            <para>The main process of the OpenStack Networking server
                is <literal>neutron-server</literal>, which is a
                Python daemon that exposes the OpenStack Networking
                API and passes user requests to the configured
                OpenStack Networking plug-in for additional
                processing. Typically, the plug-in requires access to
                a database for persistent storage (also similar to
                other OpenStack services).</para>
            <para>If your deployment uses a controller host to run
                centralized OpenStack Compute components, you can
                deploy the OpenStack Networking server on that same
                host. However, OpenStack Networking is entirely
                standalone and can be deployed on its own host as
                well. OpenStack Networking also includes additional
                agents that might be required, depending on your
                deployment:</para>

                        on each hypervisor to perform local vswitch

                        on which plug-in you are using, because some
                        plug-ins do not actually require an agent.

            <para>Like other OpenStack services, Networking enables
                cloud administrators to run one or more services on
                one or more physical devices. At one extreme, the
                cloud administrator can run all service daemons on a
                single physical host for evaluation purposes.
                Alternatively the cloud administrator can run each
                service on its own physical host and, in some cases,
                can replicate services across multiple hosts for
                redundancy. For more information, see the <citetitle

                network gateway can be on the same host. However, if
                you expect VMs to send significant traffic to or from
                the Internet, a dedicated network gateway host helps

            <para>Just like the core OpenStack Networking API provides
                abstract L2 network segments that are decoupled from
                the technology used to implement the L2 network,
                OpenStack Networking includes an API extension that
                provides abstract L3 routers that API users can
                dynamically provision and configure. These OpenStack
                Networking routers can connect multiple L2 OpenStack
                Networking networks, and can also provide a "gateway"
                that connects one or more private L2 networks to a
                shared "external" network (for example, a public
                network for access to the Internet). See the
                    <citetitle xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"

                details on common models of deploying Networking L3
                routers.</para>
            <para>The L3 router provides basic NAT capabilities on
                "gateway" ports that uplink the router to external
                networks. This router SNATs all traffic by default,
                and supports "Floating IPs", which creates a static
                one-to-one mapping from a public IP on the external
                network to a private IP on one of the other subnets
                attached to the router. This allows a tenant to
                selectively expose VMs on private networks to other
                hosts on the external network (and often to all hosts
                on the Internet). Floating IPs can be allocated and
                then mapped from one OpenStack Networking port to
                another, as needed.</para>

            <para>Security groups and security group rules allows
                administrators and tenants the ability to specify the
                type of traffic and direction (ingress/egress) that is
                allowed to pass through a port. A security group is a
                container for security group rules.</para>
            <para>When a port is created in OpenStack Networking it is
                associated with a security group. If a security group
                is not specified the port is associated with a
                'default' security group. By default, this group drops
                all ingress traffic and allows all egress. Rules can
                be added to this group in order to change the
                behaviour.</para>
            <para>To use the OpenStack Compute security group APIs or
                use OpenStack Compute to orchestrate the creation of
                ports for instances on specific security groups, you
                must complete additional configuration. You must
                configure the <filename>/etc/nova/nova.conf</filename>
                file and set the
                    <code>security_group_api=neutron</code> option on
                every node that runs <systemitem class="service"

                    class="service">nova-api</systemitem>. After you
                make this change, restart <systemitem class="service"
                    >nova-api</systemitem> and <systemitem
                    class="service">nova-compute</systemitem> to pick
                up this change. Then, you can use both the OpenStack
                Compute and OpenStack Network security group APIs at
                the same time.</para>

                    <para>The Nicira NVP QoS extension rate-limits
                        network ports to guarantee a specific amount
                        of bandwidth for each port. This extension, by
                        default, is only accessible by a tenant with
                        an admin role but is configurable through the
                            <filename>policy.json</filename> file. To
                        use this extension, create a queue and specify
                        the min/max bandwidth rates (kbps) and
                        optionally set the QoS Marking and DSCP value
                        (if your network fabric uses these values to
                        make forwarding decisions). Once created, you
                        can associate a queue with a network. Then,
                        when ports are created on that network they
                        are automatically created and associated with
                        the specific queue size that was associated
                        with the network. Because one size queue for a
                        every port on a network may not be optimal, a
                        scaling factor from the nova flavor
                        'rxtx_factor' is passed in from OpenStack
                        Compute when creating the port to scale the
                        queue.</para>
                    <para>Lastly, if you want to set a specific
                        baseline QoS policy for the amount of
                        bandwidth a single port can use (unless a
                        network queue is specified with the network a
                        port is created on) a default queue can be
                        created in neutron which then causes ports
                        created to be associated with a queue of that
                        size times the rxtx scaling factor. Note that
                        after a network or default queue is specified,
                        queues are added to ports that are
                        subsequently created but are not added to
                        existing ports.</para>

                information received from OpenStack Identity to
                authorize user requests. OpenStack Networking handles
                two kind of authorization policies:</para>

                    policies specify access criteria for specific
                    operations, possibly with fine-grained control
                    over specific attributes;</para>

                <para><emphasis role="bold">Resource-based</emphasis>
                    policies specify whether access to specific
                    resource is granted or not according to the
                    permissions configured for the resource (currently
                    available only for the network resource). The
                    actual authorization policies enforced in
                    OpenStack Networking might vary from deployment to
                    deployment.</para>
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para>The policy engine reads entries from the <emphasis
                role="italic">policy.json</emphasis> file. The actual
            location of this file might vary from distribution to
            distribution. Entries can be updated while the system is
            running, and no service restart is required. Every time
            the policy file is updated, the policies are automatically
            reloaded. Currently the only way of updating such policies
            is to edit the policy file. In this section, the terms
                <emphasis role="italic">policy</emphasis> and
                <emphasis role="italic">rule</emphasis> refer to
            objects that are specified in the same way in the policy
            file. There are no syntax differences between a rule and a
            policy. A policy is something that is matched directly
            from the OpenStack Networking policy engine. A rule is an
            element in a policy, which is evaluated. For instance in
                <code>create_subnet:
                [["admin_or_network_owner"]]</code>, <emphasis
                role="italic">create_subnet</emphasis> is a policy,
            and <emphasis role="italic"
                >admin_or_network_owner</emphasis> is a rule.</para>
        <para>Policies are triggered by the OpenStack Networking
            policy engine whenever one of them matches an OpenStack
            Networking API operation or a specific attribute being
            used in a given operation. For instance the
                <code>create_subnet</code> policy is triggered every
            time a <code>POST /v2.0/subnets</code> request is sent to
            the OpenStack Networking server; on the other hand
                <code>create_network:shared</code> is triggered every
            time the <emphasis role="italic">shared</emphasis>
            attribute is explicitly specified (and set to a value
            different from its default) in a <code>POST
                /v2.0/networks</code> request. It is also worth
            mentioning that policies can be also related to specific
            API extensions; for instance
                <code>extension:provider_network:set</code> is be
            triggered if the attributes defined by the Provider
            Network extensions are specified in an API request.</para>
        <para>An authorization policy can be composed by one or more
            rules. If more rules are specified, evaluation policy
            succeeds if any of the rules evaluates successfully; if an
            API operation matches multiple policies, then all the
            policies must evaluate successfully. Also, authorization
            rules are recursive. Once a rule is matched, the rule(s)
            can be resolved to another rule, until a terminal rule is
            reached.</para>
        <para>The OpenStack Networking policy engine currently defines
            the following kinds of terminal rules:</para>

                        the user who submits the request has the
                        specified role. For instance
                            <code>"role:admin"</code>is successful if
                        the user submitting the request is an

                        the resource specified in the current request
                        matches a specific value. For instance
                            <code>"field:networks:shared=True"</code>
                        is successful if the attribute <emphasis

                        the user's security credentials and evaluates
                        successfully if the comparison is successful.
                        For instance
                            <code>"tenant_id:%(tenant_id)s"</code> is
                        successful if the tenant identifier in the

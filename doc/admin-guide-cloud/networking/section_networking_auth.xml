    <title>Authentication and authorization</title>
    <para>Networking uses the Identity Service as the default
        authentication service. When the Identity Service is enabled,
        users who submit requests to the Networking service must
        provide an authentication token in
            <literal>X-Auth-Token</literal> request header. Users
        obtain this token by authenticating with the Identity Service
        endpoint. For more information about authentication with the
        Identity Service, see <link
            xlink:href="http://docs.openstack.org/api/openstack-identity-service/2.0/content/"
                ><citetitle>OpenStack Identity Service API v2.0
                Reference</citetitle></link>. When the Identity
        Service is enabled, it is not mandatory to specify the tenant
        ID for resources in create requests because the tenant ID is
        derived from the authentication token.</para>
    <note>
        <para>The default authorization settings only allow
            administrative users to create resources on behalf of a
            different tenant. Networking uses information received
            from Identity to authorize user requests. Networking
            handles two kind of authorization policies:</para>

                policies specify access criteria for specific
                operations, possibly with fine-grained control over
                specific attributes;</para>

            <para><emphasis role="bold">Resource-based</emphasis>
                policies specify whether access to specific resource
                is granted or not according to the permissions
                configured for the resource (currently available only
                for the network resource). The actual authorization
                policies enforced in Networking might vary from
                deployment to deployment.</para>

    <para>The policy engine reads entries from the
            <filename>policy.json</filename> file. The actual location
        of this file might vary from distribution to distribution.
        Entries can be updated while the system is running, and no
        service restart is required. Every time the policy file is
        updated, the policies are automatically reloaded. Currently
        the only way of updating such policies is to edit the policy
        file. In this section, the terms <emphasis role="italic"
            >policy</emphasis> and <emphasis role="italic"
            >rule</emphasis> refer to objects that are specified in
        the same way in the policy file. There are no syntax
        differences between a rule and a policy. A policy is something
        that is matched directly from the Networking policy engine. A
        rule is an element in a policy, which is evaluated. For
        instance in <code>create_subnet:
            [["admin_or_network_owner"]]</code>, <emphasis
            role="italic">create_subnet</emphasis> is a policy, and
            <emphasis role="italic">admin_or_network_owner</emphasis>
        is a rule.</para>
    <para>Policies are triggered by the Networking policy engine
        whenever one of them matches a Networking API operation or a
        specific attribute being used in a given operation. For
        instance the <code>create_subnet</code> policy is triggered
        every time a <code>POST /v2.0/subnets</code> request is sent
        to the Networking server; on the other hand
            <code>create_network:shared</code> is triggered every time
        the <emphasis role="italic">shared</emphasis> attribute is
        explicitly specified (and set to a value different from its
        default) in a <code>POST /v2.0/networks</code> request. It is
        also worth mentioning that policies can also be related to
        specific API extensions; for instance
            <code>extension:provider_network:set</code> is
        triggered if the attributes defined by the Provider Network
        extensions are specified in an API request.</para>
    <para>An authorization policy can be composed by one or more
        rules. If more rules are specified then the evaluation policy succeeds
        if any of the rules evaluates successfully; if an API
        operation matches multiple policies, then all the policies
        must evaluate successfully. Also, authorization rules are
        recursive. Once a rule is matched, the rule(s) can be resolved
        to another rule, until a terminal rule is reached.</para>
    <para>The Networking policy engine currently defines the following
        kinds of terminal rules:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">Role-based rules</emphasis>
                evaluate successfully if the user who submits the
                request has the specified role. For instance
                    <code>"role:admin"</code> is successful if the
                user who submits the request is an
                administrator.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">Field-based rules
                </emphasis>evaluate successfully if a field of the
                resource specified in the current request matches a
                specific value. For instance
                    <code>"field:networks:shared=True"</code> is
                successful if the <literal>shared</literal> attribute
                of the <literal>network</literal> resource is set to
                true.</para>

                compare an attribute in the resource with an attribute
                extracted from the user's security credentials and
                evaluates successfully if the comparison is
                successful. For instance
                    <code>"tenant_id:%(tenant_id)s"</code> is
                successful if the tenant identifier in the resource is
                equal to the tenant identifier of the user submitting
                the request.</para>

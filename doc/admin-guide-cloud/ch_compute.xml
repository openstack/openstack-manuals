    <para>The OpenStack Compute service allows you to control an
        Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) cloud computing platform.
        It gives you control over instances and networks, and allows
        you to manage access to the cloud through users and
        projects.</para>
    <para>Compute does not include virtualization software.
        Instead, it defines drivers that interact with underlying
        virtualization mechanisms that run on your host operating
        system, and exposes functionality over a web-based API.</para>

        <para>Compute uses a messaging-based, <literal>shared nothing</literal> architecture. All
            major components exist on multiple servers, including the compute, volume, and network
            controllers, and the object store or image service. The state of the entire system is
            stored in a database. The cloud controller communicates with the internal object store
            using HTTP, but it communicates with the scheduler, network controller, and volume
            controller using AMQP (advanced message queueing protocol). To avoid blocking a
            component while waiting for a response, Compute uses asynchronous calls, with a callback
            that is triggered when a response is received.</para>

             <para xlink:href="https://www.docker.io/">Compute controls hypervisors through an API
                 server. Selecting the best hypervisor to use can be difficult, and you must take budget,
                 resource constraints, supported features, and required technical specifications into
                 account. However, the majority of OpenStack development is done on systems using KVM and
                 Xen-based hypervisors. For a detailed list of features and support across different
                 hypervisors, see <link xlink:href="http://wiki.openstack.org/HypervisorSupportMatrix"

             <title>Tenants, users, and roles</title>
             <para>The Compute system is designed to be used by different
                 consumers in the form of tenants on a shared system, and
                 role-based access assignments. Roles control the actions
                 that a user is allowed to perform.</para>
             <para>Tenants are isolated resource containers that form the
                 principal organizational structure within the Compute
                 service. They consist of an individual VLAN, and volumes,
                 instances, images, keys, and users. A user can specify the
                 tenant by appending <literal>:project_id</literal> to
                 their access key. If no tenant is specified in the API
                 request, Compute attempts to use a tenant with the same ID
                 as the user.</para>

             <para>Roles control the actions a user is allowed to perform.
                 By default, most actions do not require a particular role,
                 but you can configure them by editing the
                 <filename>policy.json</filename> file for user roles.
                 For example, a rule can be defined so that a user must
                 have the <parameter>admin</parameter> role in order to be
                 able to allocate a public IP address.</para>
             <para>A tenant limits users' access to particular images. Each
                 user is assigned a user name and password. Keypairs
                 granting access to an instance are enabled for each user,
                 but quotas are set, so that each tenant can control
                 resource consumption across available hardware
                 resources.</para>
             <note>

                     terminology, some command-line tools use
                     <parameter>--project_id</parameter> where you
                     would normally expect to enter a tenant ID.</para>

             <title>Block storage</title>
             <para>OpenStack provides two classes of block storage:
                 ephemeral storage and persistent volumes. Volumes are
                 persistent virtualized block devices independent of any
                 particular instance.</para>
             <para>Ephemeral storage is associated with a single unique
                 instance, and it exists only for the life of that
                 instance. The amount of ephemeral storage is defined by
                 the flavor of the instance. Generally, the root file
                 system for an instance will be stored on ephemeral
                 storage. It persists across reboots of the guest operating
                 system, but when the instance is deleted, the ephemeral
                 storage is also removed.</para>
             <para>In addition to the ephemeral root volume, all flavors
                 except the smallest, <filename>m1.tiny</filename>, also
                 provide an additional ephemeral block device of between 20
                 and 160&nbsp;GB. These sizes can be configured to suit your
                 environment. This is presented as a raw block device with
                 no partition table or file system. Cloud-aware operating
                 system images can discover, format, and mount these
                 storage devices. For example, the <systemitem
                     class="service">cloud-init</systemitem> package
                 included in Ubuntu's stock cloud images format this space
                 as an <filename>ext3</filename> file system and mount it
                 on <filename>/mnt</filename>. This is a feature of the
                 guest operating system you are using, and is not an
                 OpenStack mechanism. OpenStack only provisions the raw
                 storage.</para>
             <para>Persistent volumes are created by users and their size
                 is limited only by the user's quota and availability
                 limits. Upon initial creation, volumes are raw block
                 devices without a partition table or a file system. To
                 partition or format volumes, you must attach them to an
                 instance. Once they are attached to an instance, you can
                 use persistent volumes in much the same way as you would
                 use external hard disk drive. You can attach volumes to
                 only one instance at a time, although you can detach and
                 reattach volumes to as many different instances as you
                 like.</para>
             <para>You can configure persistent volumes as bootable and use them to provide a persistent
                 virtual instance similar to traditional non-cloud-based virtualization systems.
                 Typically, the resulting instance can also still have ephemeral storage depending on the
                 flavor selected, but the root file system can be on the persistent volume and its state
                 maintained even if the instance is shut down. For more information about this type of
                 configuration, see the <link
                     xlink:href="http://docs.openstack.org/trunk/config-reference/content/">

             </para>
             <note>
                 <para>Persistent volumes do not provide concurrent access
                     from multiple instances. That type of configuration
                     requires a traditional network file system like NFS or
                     CIFS, or a cluster file system such as GlusterFS.
                     These systems can be built within an OpenStack cluster
                     or provisioned outside of it, but OpenStack software
                     does not provide these features.</para>

             <para>In OpenStack the base operating system is usually copied
                 from an image stored in the OpenStack Image Service. This
                 is the most common case and results in an ephemeral
                 instance that starts from a known template state and loses
                 all accumulated states on shutdown. It is also possible to
                 put an operating system on a persistent volume in the
                 Nova-Volume or Cinder volume system. This gives a more
                 traditional persistent system that accumulates states,
                 which are preserved across restarts. To get a list of
                 available images on your system run:

             <para>The following basic categories describe the service architecture and what's going
                 on within the cloud controller.</para>
             <simplesect>
                 <title>API server</title>
                 <para>At the heart of the cloud framework is an API server. This API server makes
                     command and control of the hypervisor, storage, and networking programmatically
                     available to users.</para>
                 <para>The API endpoints are basic HTTP web services
                     which handle authentication, authorization, and
                     basic command and control functions using various
                     API interfaces under the Amazon, Rackspace, and
                     related models. This enables API compatibility
                     with multiple existing tool sets created for
                     interaction with offerings from other vendors.
                     This broad compatibility prevents vendor
                     lock-in.</para>
             </simplesect>
             <simplesect>
                 <title>Message queue</title>
                 <para>A messaging queue brokers the interaction
                     between compute nodes (processing), the networking
                     controllers (software which controls network
                     infrastructure), API endpoints, the scheduler
                     (determines which physical hardware to allocate to
                     a virtual resource), and similar components.
                     Communication to and from the cloud controller is
                     by HTTP requests through multiple API
                     endpoints.</para>
                 <para>A typical message passing event begins with the API server receiving a request
                     from a user. The API server authenticates the user and ensures that the user is
                     permitted to issue the subject command. The availability of objects implicated in
                     the request is evaluated and, if available, the request is routed to the queuing
                     engine for the relevant workers. Workers continually listen to the queue based on
                     their role, and occasionally their type host name. When an applicable work request
                     arrives on the queue, the worker takes assignment of the task and begins its
                     execution. Upon completion, a response is dispatched to the queue which is received
                     by the API server and relayed to the originating user. Database entries are queried,
                     added, or removed as necessary throughout the process.</para>

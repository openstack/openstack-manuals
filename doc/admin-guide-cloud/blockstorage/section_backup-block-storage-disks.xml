    <title>Back up Block Storage service disks</title>
    <para>While you can use the LVM snapshot to create snapshots, you
        can also use it to back up your volumes. By using LVM
        snapshot, you reduce the size of the backup; only existing
        data is backed up instead of the entire volume.</para>
    <para>To back up a volume, you must create a snapshot of it. An
        LVM snapshot is the exact copy of a logical volume, which
        contains data in a frozen state. This prevents data
        corruption, because data cannot be manipulated during the
        volume creation process. Remember that the volumes created
        through a <command>nova volume-create</command> command exist
        in an LVM logical volume.</para>
    <para>You must also make sure that the operating system is not
        using the volume, and that all data has been flushed on the
        guest file systems. This usually means that those file systems
        have to be unmounted during the snapshot creation. They can be
        mounted again as soon as the logical volume snapshot has been
        created.</para>
    <para>Before you create the snapshot, you must have enough space
        to save it. As a precaution, you should have at least twice as
        much space as the potential snapshot size. If insufficient
        space is available, the snapshot might become
        corrupted.</para>
    <para>For this example, assume that a 100&nbsp;GB volume named
            <literal>volume-00000001</literal> was created for an
        instance while only 4&nbsp;GB are used. This example uses these
        commands to back up only those 4&nbsp;GB:</para>

                <step>
                    <para>Create the snapshot; you can do this while
                        the volume is attached to an instance:</para>
                    <screen><prompt>#</prompt> <userinput>lvcreate --size 10G --snapshot --name volume-00000001-snapshot /dev/cinder-volumes/volume-00000001</userinput></screen>
                    <para>Use the <option>--snapshot</option>
                        configuration option to tell LVM that you want
                        a snapshot of an already existing volume. The
                        command includes the size of the space
                        reserved for the snapshot volume, the name of
                        the snapshot, and the path of an already
                        existing volume. Generally, this path is
                                <filename>/dev/cinder-volumes/<replaceable>VOLUME_NAME</replaceable></filename>.</para>
                    <para>The size does not have to be the same as the

                        defines the space that LVM reserves for the
                        snapshot volume. As a precaution, the size
                        should be the same as that of the original
                        volume, even if the whole space is not
                        currently used by the snapshot.</para>

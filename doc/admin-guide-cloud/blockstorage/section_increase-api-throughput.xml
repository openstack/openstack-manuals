  <title>Increase Block Storage API service throughput</title>
  <para>By default, the Block Storage API service runs in one process.
    This limits the number of API requests that the Block Storage
    service can process at any given time. In a production
    environment, you should increase the Block Storage API throughput
    by allowing the Block Storage API service to run in as many
    processes as the machine capacity allows.</para>
  <note>
    <para>The Block Storage API service is named
      <literal>openstack-cinder-api</literal> on the following
      distributions: CentOS, Fedora, openSUSE, Red Hat Enterprise
      Linux, and SUSE Linux Enterprise.  In Ubuntu and Debian
      distributions, the Block Storage API service is named
      <literal>cinder-api</literal>.</para>
  </note>
  <para>To do so, use the Block Storage API service option
    <parameter>osapi_volume_workers</parameter>. This option allows
    you to specify the number of API service workers (or OS processes)
    to launch for the Block Storage API service.</para>
  <para>To configure this option, open the
    <filename>/etc/cinder/cinder.conf</filename> configuration file
    and set the <literal>osapi_volume_workers</literal> configuration
    key to the number of CPU cores/threads on a machine.</para>
  <para>On distributions that
    include <application>openstack-config</application>, you can
    configure this by running the following command instead:</para>
  <screen><prompt>#</prompt> <userinput>openstack-config --set /etc/cinder/cinder.conf \
  DEFAULT osapi_volume_workers <replaceable>CORES</replaceable></userinput></screen>
  <para>Replace <replaceable>CORES</replaceable> with the number of CPU
    cores/threads on a machine.</para>

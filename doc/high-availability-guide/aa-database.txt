=== Database

The first step is installing the database that sits at the heart of the
cluster.  When we talk about High Availability, we talk about several databases (for redundancy) and a
means to keep them synchronized.  In this case, we must choose the
MySQL database, along with Galera for synchronous multi-master replication.

The choice of database isn’t a foregone conclusion; you’re not required
to use MySQL.  It is, however, a fairly common choice in OpenStack
installations, so we’ll cover it here.

==== MySQL with Galera


Rather than starting with a vanilla version of MySQL, and then adding
Galera, you will want to install a version of MySQL patched for wsrep
(Write Set REPlication) from https://launchpad.net/codership-mysql/0.7.
The wsrep API is suitable for configuring MySQL High Availability in
OpenStack because it supports synchronous replication.

Note that the installation requirements call for careful attention. Read
the guide https://launchpadlibrarian.net/66669857/README-wsrep
to ensure you follow all the required steps.

Installing Galera through a MySQL version patched for wsrep:

1. Download Galera from https://launchpad.net/galera/+download, and
  install the *.rpms or *.debs, which takes care of any dependencies
  that your system doesn’t already have installed.

2. Adjust the configuration:

In the system-wide +my.conf+ file, make sure mysqld isn’t bound to
127.0.0.1, and that +/etc/mysql/conf.d/+ is included.
Typically you can find this file at +/etc/my.cnf+:

----
[mysqld]
...
!includedir /etc/mysql/conf.d/
...
#bind-address = 127.0.0.1
----

When adding a new node, you must configure it with a MySQL account that
can access the other nodes. The new node must be able to request a state
snapshot from one of the existing nodes:

3. Specify your MySQL account information in +/etc/mysql/conf.d/wsrep.cnf+:

----
wsrep_sst_auth=wsrep_sst:wspass
----

4. Connect as root and grant privileges to that user:

----
$ mysql -e "SET wsrep_on=OFF; GRANT ALL ON *.* TO wsrep_sst@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'wspass'";
----

5. Remove user accounts with empty usernames because they cause problems:

----
$ mysql -e "SET wsrep_on=OFF; DELETE FROM mysql.user WHERE user='';"
----

6. Set up certain mandatory configuration options within MySQL itself.
These include:

----
query_cache_size=0
binlog_format=ROW
default_storage_engine=innodb
innodb_autoinc_lock_mode=2
innodb_doublewrite=1
----

7. Check that the nodes can access each other through the firewall.
Depending on your environment, this might mean adjusting iptables, as in:

----
# iptables --insert RH-Firewall-1-INPUT 1 --proto tcp --source <my IP>/24 --destination <my IP>/32 --dport 3306 -j ACCEPT
# iptables --insert RH-Firewall-1-INPUT 1 --proto tcp --source <my IP>/24 --destination <my IP>/32 --dport 4567 -j ACCEPT
----

This might also mean configuring any NAT firewall between nodes to allow
direct connections. You might need to disable SELinux, or configure it to
allow mysqld to listen to sockets at unprivileged ports.

Now you’re ready to create the cluster.

===== Create the cluster

In creating a cluster, you first start a single instance, which creates
the cluster. The rest of the MySQL instances then connect to
that cluster:

An example of creating the cluster:

1. Start on +10.0.0.10+ by executing the command:

----
# service mysql start wsrep_cluster_address=gcomm://
----

2. Connect to that cluster on the rest of the nodes by referencing the
address of that node, as in:

----
# service mysql start wsrep_cluster_address=gcomm://10.0.0.10
----

You also have the option to set the +wsrep_cluster_address+ in the
+/etc/mysql/conf.d/wsrep.cnf+ file, or within the client itself.  (In
fact, for some systems, such as MariaDB or Percona, this may be your
only option.)

An example of checking the status of the cluster.

1. Open the MySQL client and check the status of the various parameters:

----
mysql> SET GLOBAL wsrep_cluster_address='<cluster address string>';
mysql> SHOW STATUS LIKE 'wsrep%';
----

You should see a status that looks something like this:

----
mysql> show status like 'wsrep%';

==== Galera monitoring scripts

(Coming soon)

==== Other ways to provide a highly available database

MySQL with Galera is by no means the only way to achieve database HA.
MariaDB (https://mariadb.org/) and Percona (http://www.percona.com/)
also work with Galera. You also have the option to use Postgres, which
has its own replication, or another database HA option.

        <simpara>Most of OpenStack services use an application to offer persistence and store ephemeral data (like tokens).
Memcached is one of them and can scale-out easily without specific trick.</simpara>
        <simpara>To install and configure it, read the <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://code.google.com/p/memcached/wiki/NewStart">official documentation</link>.</simpara>
        <simpara>Memory caching is managed by oslo-incubator so the way to use multiple memcached servers is the same for all projects.</simpara>
        <simpara>Example with two hosts:</simpara>
        <screen>memcached_servers = controller1:11211,controller2:11211</screen>
        <simpara>By default, controller1 handles the caching service but if the host goes down, controller2 does the job.
For more information about memcached installation, see the OpenStack
Cloud Administrator Guide.</simpara>

          <title>Highly available RabbitMQ</title>
        </info>
        <simpara>RabbitMQ is the default AMQP server used by many OpenStack
services. Making the RabbitMQ service highly available involves:</simpara>

        <note>
          <simpara>There is an alternative method of configuring RabbitMQ for high
availability. That approach, known as
<link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/ha.html">active-active mirrored queues</link>,
happens to be the one preferred by the RabbitMQ developers — however
it has shown less than ideal consistency and reliability in OpenStack
clusters. Thus, at the time of writing, the Pacemaker/DRBD based
approach remains the recommended one for OpenStack environments,
although this may change in the near future as RabbitMQ active-active
mirrored queues mature.</simpara>

          <simpara>The Pacemaker based RabbitMQ server requires a DRBD resource from
which it mounts the <literal>/var/lib/rabbitmq</literal> directory. In this example,
the DRBD resource is simply named <literal>rabbitmq</literal>:</simpara>
          <formalpara>
            <info>
              <title><literal>rabbitmq</literal> DRBD resource configuration (<literal>/etc/drbd.d/rabbitmq.res</literal>)</title>
            </info>
            <para>
              <screen>resource rabbitmq {
  device    minor 1;
  disk      "/dev/data/rabbitmq";
  meta-disk internal;
  on node1 {
    address ipv4 10.0.42.100:7701;
  }
  on node2 {
    address ipv4 10.0.42.254:7701;
  }
}</screen>
            </para>
          </formalpara>
          <simpara>This resource uses an underlying local disk (in DRBD terminology, a
<emphasis>backing device</emphasis>) named <literal>/dev/data/rabbitmq</literal> on both cluster nodes,
<literal>node1</literal> and <literal>node2</literal>. Normally, this would be an LVM Logical Volume
specifically set aside for this purpose. The DRBD <literal>meta-disk</literal> is
<literal>internal</literal>, meaning DRBD-specific metadata is being stored at the end
of the <literal>disk</literal> device itself. The device is configured to communicate
between IPv4 addresses 10.0.42.100 and 10.0.42.254, using TCP port
7701. Once enabled, it will map to a local DRBD block device with the
device minor number 1, that is, <literal>/dev/drbd1</literal>.</simpara>
          <simpara>Enabling a DRBD resource is explained in detail in

User’s Guide</link>. In brief, the proper sequence of commands is this:</simpara>
          <screen>drbdadm create-md rabbitmq <co xml:id="CO4-1"/>
drbdadm up rabbitmq <co xml:id="CO4-2"/>

          <simpara>Once the DRBD resource is running and in the primary role (and
potentially still in the process of running the initial device
synchronization), you may proceed with creating the filesystem for
RabbitMQ data. XFS is generally the recommended filesystem:</simpara>
          <screen>mkfs -t xfs /dev/drbd1</screen>
          <simpara>You may also use the alternate device path for the DRBD device, which
may be easier to remember as it includes the self-explanatory resource
name:</simpara>
          <screen>mkfs -t xfs /dev/drbd/by-res/rabbitmq</screen>
          <simpara>Once completed, you may safely return the device to the secondary
role. Any ongoing device synchronization will continue in the
background:</simpara>

          <simpara>In order for Pacemaker monitoring to function properly, you must
ensure that RabbitMQ’s <literal>.erlang.cookie</literal> files are identical on all
nodes, regardless of whether DRBD is mounted there or not. The
simplest way of doing so is to take an existing <literal>.erlang.cookie</literal> from
one of your nodes, copying it to the RabbitMQ data directory on the
other node, and also copying it to the DRBD-backed filesystem.</simpara>
          <screen>node1:# scp -a /var/lib/rabbitmq/.erlang.cookie node2:/var/lib/rabbitmq/

            <title>Configure OpenStack services for highly available RabbitMQ</title>
          </info>
          <simpara>Your OpenStack services must now point their RabbitMQ configuration to
the highly available, virtual cluster IP address — rather than a
RabbitMQ server’s physical IP address as you normally would.</simpara>
          <simpara>For OpenStack Image, for example, if your RabbitMQ service IP address is
192.168.42.100 as in the configuration explained here, you would use
the following line in your OpenStack Image API configuration file
(<literal>glance-api.conf</literal>):</simpara>
          <screen>rabbit_host = 192.168.42.100</screen>
          <simpara>No other changes are necessary to your OpenStack configuration. If the
node currently hosting your RabbitMQ experiences a problem
necessitating service failover, your OpenStack services may experience
a brief RabbitMQ interruption, as they would in the event of a network
hiccup, and then continue to run normally.</simpara>

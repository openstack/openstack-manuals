.. list-table:: Description of Linux Bridge agent configuration options
   :header-rows: 1
   :class: config-ref-table

   * - Configuration option = Default value
     - Description
   * - **[LINUX_BRIDGE]**
     -
   * - ``bridge_mappings`` =
     - (ListOpt) List of <physical_network>:<physical_bridge>
   * - ``physical_interface_mappings`` =
     - (ListOpt) Comma-separated list of <physical_network>:<physical_interface> tuples mapping physical network names to the agent's node-specific physical network interfaces to be used for flat and VLAN networks. All physical networks listed in network_vlan_ranges on the server should have mappings to appropriate interfaces on each agent.
   * - **[VXLAN]**
     -
   * - ``enable_vxlan`` = ``True``
     - (BoolOpt) Enable VXLAN on the agent. Can be enabled when agent is managed by ml2 plugin using linuxbridge mechanism driver
   * - ``l2_population`` = ``False``
     - (BoolOpt) Extension to use alongside ml2 plugin's l2population mechanism driver. It enables the plugin to populate VXLAN forwarding table.
   * - ``local_ip`` = ``None``
     - (IPOpt) Local IP address of the VXLAN endpoints.
   * - ``tos`` = ``None``
     - (IntOpt) TOS for vxlan interface protocol packets.
   * - ``ttl`` = ``None``
     - (IntOpt) TTL for vxlan interface protocol packets.
   * - ``vxlan_group`` = ``224.0.0.1``
     - (StrOpt) Multicast group(s) for vxlan interface. A range of group addresses may be specified by using CIDR notation. Specifying a range allows different VNIs to use different group addresses, reducing or eliminating spurious broadcast traffic to the tunnel endpoints. To reserve a unique group for each possible (24-bit) VNI, use a /8 such as 239.0.0.0/8. This setting must be the same on all the agents.

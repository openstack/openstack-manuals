     -
   * - ``disable_non_metric_meters`` = ``True``
     - (BoolOpt) WARNING: Ceilometer historically offered the ability to store events as meters. This usage is NOT advised as it can flood the metering database and cause performance degradation.
   * - ``pipeline_processing_queues`` = ``10``
     - (IntOpt) Number of queues to parallelize workload across. This value should be larger than the number of active notification agents for optimal results.

    <para>Increasing server density means sacrificing resource
        capacity or expandability, however, increasing resource
        capacity and expandability increases cost and decreases server
        density. As a result, determining the best server hardware for
        a general purpose OpenStack architecture means understanding
        how choice of form factor will impact the rest of the
        design. The following list outlines the form factors to
        choose from:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
            <para>Blade servers typically support dual-socket
                multi-core CPUs, which is the configuration generally
                considered to be the "sweet spot" for a general
                purpose cloud deployment. Blades also offer
                outstanding density. As an example, both HP
                BladeSystem and Dell PowerEdge M1000e support up to 16
                servers in only 10 rack units. However, the blade
                servers themselves often have limited storage and
                networking capacity. Additionally, the expandability
                of many blade servers can be limited.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>1U rack-mounted servers occupy only a single rack
                unit. Their benefits include high density, support for
                dual-socket multi-core CPUs, and support for
                reasonable RAM amounts. This form factor offers
                limited storage capacity, limited network capacity,
                and limited expandability.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>2U rack-mounted servers offer the expanded storage
                and networking capacity that 1U servers tend to lack,
                but with a corresponding decrease in server density
                (half the density offered by 1U rack-mounted
                servers).</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>Larger rack-mounted servers, such as 4U servers,
                will tend to offer even greater CPU capacity, often
                supporting four or even eight CPU sockets. These
                servers often have much greater expandability so will
                provide the best option for upgradability. This means,
                however, that the servers have a much lower server
                density and a much greater hardware cost.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>"Sled servers" are rack-mounted servers that support
                multiple independent servers in a single 2U or 3U
                enclosure. This form factor offers increased density
                over typical 1U-2U rack-mounted servers but tends to
                suffer from limitations in the amount of storage or
                network capacity each individual server
                supports.</para>
        </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>The best form factor for server hardware
        supporting a general purpose OpenStack cloud is driven by
        outside business and cost factors. No single reference
        architecture will apply to all implementations; the decision
        must flow from user requirements, technical
        considerations, and operational considerations. Here are some
        of the key factors that influence the selection of server
        hardware:</para>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>Instance density</term>
        <listitem>
            <para>Sizing is an important
                consideration for a general purpose OpenStack cloud.
                The expected or anticipated number of instances that
                each hypervisor can host is a common metric used in
                sizing the deployment. The selected server hardware
                needs to support the expected or anticipated instance
                density.</para>

      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>Host density</term>
        <listitem>
            <para>Physical data centers have limited
                physical space, power, and cooling. The number of
                hosts (or hypervisors) that can be fitted into a given
                metric (rack, rack unit, or floor tile) is another
                important method of sizing. Floor weight is an often
                overlooked consideration. The data center floor must
                be able to support the weight of the proposed number
                of hosts within a rack or set of racks. These factors
                need to be applied as part of the host density
                calculation and server hardware selection.</para>

      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>Power density</term>
        <listitem>
            <para>Data centers have a specified amount
                of power fed to a given rack or set of racks. Older
                data centers may have a power density as power as low
                as 20 AMPs per rack, while more recent data centers
                can be architected to support power densities as high
                as 120 AMP per rack. The selected server hardware must
                take power density into account.</para>

      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>Network connectivity</term>
        <listitem>
            <para>The selected server hardware
                must have the appropriate number of network
                connections, as well as the right type of network
                connections, in order to support the proposed
                architecture. Ensure that, at a minimum, there are at
                least two diverse network connections coming into each
                rack. For architectures requiring even more
                redundancy, it might be necessary to confirm that the
                network connections are from diverse telecom
                providers. Many data centers have that capacity
                available.</para>

      </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>
    <para>The selection of form factors or architectures affects the selection
        of server hardware. For example, if the design is a scale-out storage architecture,
        then the server hardware selection will require careful consideration
        when matching the requirements set to the commercial solution.</para>
    <para>Ensure that the selected server hardware
        is configured to support enough storage capacity (or storage
        expandability) to match the requirements of selected scale-out
        storage solution. For example, if a centralized storage
        solution is required, such as a centralized storage array from
        a storage vendor that has InfiniBand or FDDI connections, the
        server hardware will need to have appropriate network adapters
        installed to be compatible with the storage array vendor's
        specifications.</para>
    <para>Similarly, the network architecture will have an impact on
        the server hardware selection and vice versa. For example,
        make sure that the server is configured with enough additional
        network ports and expansion cards to support all of the
        networks required. There is variability in network expansion
        cards, so it is important to be aware of potential impacts or
        interoperability issues with other components in the
        architecture.</para>

        <title>Selecting storage hardware</title>
    <para>Storage hardware architecture is largely determined by the
        selected storage architecture. The selection of storage
        architecture, as well as the corresponding storage hardware,
        is determined by evaluating possible solutions against the
        critical factors, the user requirements, technical
        considerations, and operational considerations. Factors that need to be
        incorporated into the storage architecture include:</para>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>Cost</term>
        <listitem>
            <para>Storage can be a significant portion of the
                overall system cost. For an organization that is concerned
                with vendor support, a commercial storage solution is
                advisable, although it comes with a higher price
                tag. If initial capital expenditure requires
                minimization, designing a system based on commodity
                hardware would apply. The trade-off is potentially
                higher support costs and a greater risk of
                incompatibility and interoperability issues.</para>

            <para>Scalability, along with expandability, is a major
                consideration in a general purpose OpenStack cloud. It
                might be difficult to predict the final intended size
                of the implementation as there are no established
                usage patterns for a general purpose cloud. It might

            <para>Expandability is a major architecture factor for
                storage solutions with general purpose OpenStack
                cloud. A storage solution that expands
                to 50&nbsp;PB is considered more expandable than a
                solution that only scales to 10&nbsp;PB. This metric is
                related to, but different, from scalability, which is a
                measure of the solution's performance as it expands. For example, the storage
                architecture for a cloud that is intended for a development
                platform may not have the same expandability and scalability
                requirements as a cloud that is intended for a
                commercial product.</para>

    <para>Using a scale-out storage solution with direct-attached
        storage (DAS) in the servers is well suited for a general
        purpose OpenStack cloud.
        For example, it is possible to populate storage in either the compute
        hosts similar to a grid computing solution, or into hosts dedicated to
        providing block storage exclusively. When deploying storage in the
        compute hosts appropriate hardware, that can support both the
        storage and compute services on the same hardware, will be required.</para>
    <para>Understanding the requirements of cloud services will help
        determine what scale-out solution should be used. Determining if
        a single, highly expandable and highly vertical, scalable,
        centralized storage array should be included in the design.
        Once an approach has been determined, the storage hardware
        needs to be selected based on this criteria.</para>
    <para>This list expands upon the potential impacts for including a

            <para>Hardware resources selected for the resource nodes

                ensuring the design can support adding capacity is
                important. Hardware nodes selected for object storage
                should be capable of support a large number of inexpensive
                disks with no reliance on RAID controller cards.
                Hardware nodes selected for block storage should be capable
                of supporting high speed storage solutions and RAID controller
                cards to provide performance and redundancy to storage at a
                hardware level.

        For example, selecting networking hardware that only supports
        Gigabit Ethernet (GbE) will impact the overall design. Similarly,
        deciding to use 10 Gigabit Ethernet (10&nbsp;GbE) will have a
        number of impacts on various areas of the overall design.</para>
    <para>There are more subtle design impacts that need to be considered.
        The selection of certain networking hardware (and the networking software)
        affects the management tools that can be used. There are
        exceptions to this; the rise of "open" networking software
        that supports a range of networking hardware means that there
        are instances where the relationship between networking
        hardware and networking software are not as tightly defined.
        An example of this type of software is Cumulus Linux, which is
        capable of running on a number of switch vendor's hardware
        solutions.</para>

                expensive and should also be considered, as it is

                tolerance. With regard to the network infrastructure

However, when multiple regions are available, it is left to the end user to decide in which region to schedule the new instance. The dashboard will present the user with the first region in your configuration. The API and CLI tools will not execute commands unless a valid region is specified. It is therefore important to provide documentation to your users describing the region layout as well as calling out that quotas are region-specific. If a user reaches his or her quota in one region, OpenStack will not automatically build new instances in another. Documenting specific examples will help users understand how to operate the cloud, thereby reducing calls and tickets filed with the help desk."

The first is to run a load balancer either within OpenStack as an instance, or use an external load balancing solution. In the internal scenario, load balancing software, such as HAproxy, can be managed with Networking's Load-Balancer-as-a-Service (LBaaS). This is specifically to manage the Virtual IP (VIP) while a dual-homed connection from the HAproxy instance connects the public network with the tenant private network that hosts all of the content servers. In the external scenario, a load balancer would need to serve the VIP and also be joined to the tenant overlay network through external means or routed to it via private addresses."

Other applications may wish to directly participate in a routing protocol, either as a passive observer as in the case of a looking glass, or as an active participant in the form of a route reflector.

Some general purpose clouds are built for commercial customer facing products, but there are plenty of other reasons that might make the general purpose cloud the right choice. A small cloud service provider (CSP) might want to build a general purpose cloud rather than a massively scalable cloud because they do not have the deep financial resources needed, or because they do not or will not know in advance the purposes for which their customers are going to use the cloud. For some users, the advantages cloud itself offers mean an enhancement of revenue opportunity. For others, the fact that a general purpose cloud provides only baseline functionality will be a disincentive for use, leading to a potential stagnation of potential revenue opportunities."

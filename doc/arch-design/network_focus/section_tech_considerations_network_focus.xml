    <title>Technical considerations</title>
    <para>When you design an OpenStack network architecture, you must
        consider layer-2 and layer-3 issues. Layer-2
        decisions involve those made at the data-link layer, such as
        the decision to use Ethernet versus Token Ring. Layer-3 decisions
        involve those made about the protocol layer and the point when
        IP comes into the picture. As an example, a completely
        internal OpenStack network can exist at layer 2 and ignore
        layer 3 however, in order for any traffic to go outside of
        that cloud, to another network, or to the Internet, a layer-3
        router or switch must be involved.</para>
    <para>
      The past few years have seen two competing trends in
      networking. One trend leans towards building data center network
      architectures based on layer-2 networking. Another trend treats
      the cloud environment essentially as a miniature version of the
      Internet. This approach is radically different from the network
      architecture approach that is used in the staging environment:
      the Internet is based entirely on layer-3 routing rather than
      layer-2 switching.
    </para>
    <para>
      A network designed on layer-2 protocols has advantages over one
      designed on layer-3 protocols. In spite of the difficulties of
      using a bridge to perform the network role of a router, many
      vendors, customers, and service providers choose to use Ethernet
      in as many parts of their networks as possible. The benefits of
      selecting a layer-2 design are:

    <para>Most information starts and ends inside Ethernet frames.
        Today this applies to data, voice (for example, VoIP) and
        video (for example, web cameras). The concept is that, if more
        of the end-to-end transfer of information from a source to a
        destination can be done in the form of Ethernet frames, more
        of the benefits of Ethernet can be realized on the network.
        Though it is not a substitute for IP networking, networking at
        layer 2 can be a powerful adjunct to IP networking.

          No need to keep track of address configuration as systems

          protocols might work well in a data center with hundreds
          of physical machines, cloud data centers have the
          additional burden of needing to keep track of all virtual
          machine addresses and networks. In these data centers, it
          is not uncommon for one physical node to support 30-40

      <para>
        Networking at the frame level says nothing
        about the presence or absence of IP addresses at the packet
        level. Almost all ports, links, and devices on a network of
        LAN switches still have IP addresses, as do all the source and
        destination hosts. There are many reasons for the continued
        need for IP addressing. The largest one is the need to manage
        the network. A device or link without an IP address is usually
        invisible to most management applications. Utilities including
        remote access for diagnostics, file transfer of configurations
        and software, and similar applications cannot run without IP
        addresses as well as MAC addresses.</para>

    <para>It is important to know that layer 2 has a very limited set
        of network management tools. It is very difficult to control
        traffic, as it does not have mechanisms to manage the network
        or shape the traffic, and network troubleshooting is very
        difficult. One reason for this difficulty is network devices
        have no IP addresses. As a result, there is no reasonable way
        to check network delay in a layer-2 network.</para>
    <para>On large layer-2 networks, configuring ARP learning can also
        be complicated. The setting for the MAC address timer on
        switches is critical and, if set incorrectly, can cause
        significant performance problems. As an example, the Cisco
        default MAC address timer is extremely long. Migrating MACs to
        different physical locations to support instance migration can
        be a significant problem. In this case, the network
        information maintained in the switches could be out of sync
        with the new location of the instance.</para>
    <para>In a layer-2 network, all devices are aware of all MACs,
        even those that belong to instances. The network state
        information in the backbone changes whenever an instance is
        started or stopped. As a result there is far too much churn in
        the MAC tables on the backbone switches.</para></section>

    <para>The main limitation of layer 3 is that there is no built-in
        isolation mechanism comparable to the VLANs in layer-2
        networks. Furthermore, the hierarchical nature of IP addresses
        means that an instance will also be on the same subnet as its
        physical host. This means that it cannot be migrated outside
        of the subnet easily. For these reasons, network
        virtualization needs to use IP <glossterm>encapsulation</glossterm>
        and software at
        the end hosts for both isolation, as well as for separation of
        the addressing in the virtual layer from addressing in the
        physical layer. Other potential disadvantages of layer 3
        include the need to design an IP addressing scheme rather than
        relying on the switches to automatically keep track of the MAC
        addresses and to configure the interior gateway routing
        protocol in the switches.</para>

      Research into the mean time between failures (MTBF) on switches
      is between 100,000 and 200,000 hours. This number is dependent
      on the ambient temperature of the switch in the data
      center. When properly cooled and maintained, this translates to
      between 11 and 22 years before failure. Even in the worst case
      of poor ventilation and high ambient temperatures in the data
      center, the MTBF is still 2-3 years. This is based on published

      <title>Preparing for the future: IPv6 support</title>
    <para>
      One of the most important networking topics today is the
      impending exhaustion of IPv4 addresses. In early 2014, ICANN
      announced that they started allocating the final IPv4 address
      blocks to the Regional Internet Registries (<link
      xlink:href="http://www.internetsociety.org/deploy360/blog/2014/05/goodbye-ipv4-iana-starts-allocating-final-address-blocks/">http://www.internetsociety.org/deploy360/blog/2014/05/goodbye-ipv4-iana-starts-allocating-final-address-blocks/</link>).
      This means the IPv4 address space is close to being fully
      allocated. As a result, it will soon become difficult to
      allocate more IPv4 addresses to an application that has
      experienced growth, or is expected to scale out, due to the lack
      of unallocated IPv4 address blocks.</para>
    <para>For network focused applications the future is the IPv6
        protocol. IPv6 increases the address space significantly,
        fixes long standing issues in the IPv4 protocol, and will
        become essential for network focused applications in the
        future.</para>
    <para>OpenStack Networking supports IPv6 when configured to take advantage of
        the feature. To enable it, simply create an IPv6 subnet in

        and receive traffic. Applications that provide file storage
        for customers will allocate bandwidth and links to favor
        incoming traffic, whereas video streaming applications will
        allocate bandwidth and links to favor outgoing traffic.</para></section>

    <para>It is important to analyze the applications' tolerance for
        latency and jitter when designing an environment to support
        network focused applications. Certain applications, for
        example VoIP, are less tolerant of latency and jitter. Where
        latency and jitter are concerned, certain applications may
        require tuning of QoS parameters and network device queues to
        ensure that they are queued for transmit immediately or
        guaranteed minimum bandwidth. Since OpenStack currently does
        not support these functions, some considerations may need to
        be made for the network plug-in selected.</para>
    <para>The location of a service may also impact the application or
        consumer experience. If an application is designed to serve
        differing content to differing users it will need to be
        designed to properly direct connections to those specific
        locations. Use a multi-site installation for these situations,
        where appropriate.</para>
    <para>Networking can be implemented in two separate
        ways. The legacy networking (nova-network) provides a flat DHCP network
        with a single broadcast domain. This implementation does not
        support tenant isolation networks or advanced plug-ins, but it
        is currently the only way to implement a distributed layer-3
        agent using the multi_host configuration.
        OpenStack Networking (neutron) is the official networking implementation
        and provides a pluggable architecture that supports a large
        variety of network methods. Some of these include a layer-2
        only provider network model, external device plug-ins, or even
        OpenFlow controllers.</para>
    <para>Networking at large scales becomes a set of boundary
        questions. The determination of how large a layer-2 domain
        needs to be is based on the amount of nodes within the domain
        and the amount of broadcast traffic that passes between
        instances. Breaking layer-2 boundaries may require the
        implementation of overlay networks and tunnels. This decision
        is a balancing act between the need for a smaller overhead or
        a need for a smaller domain.</para>
    <para>When selecting network devices, be aware that making this
        decision based on the greatest port density often comes with a
        drawback. Aggregation switches and routers have not all kept
        pace with Top of Rack switches and may induce bottlenecks on
        north-south traffic. As a result, it may be possible for
        massive amounts of downstream network utilization to impact
        upstream network devices, impacting service to the cloud.
        Since OpenStack does not currently provide a mechanism for
        traffic shaping or rate limiting, it is necessary to implement
        these features at the network hardware level.</para>

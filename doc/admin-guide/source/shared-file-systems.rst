Shared File Systems
===================

Shared File Systems service provides a set of services for management of
shared file systems in a multi-project cloud environment. The service resembles
OpenStack block-based storage management from the OpenStack Block Storage
service project. With the Shared File Systems service, you can
create a remote file system, mount the file system on your instances, and then
read and write data from your instances to and from your file system.

The Shared File Systems service serves same purpose as the Amazon Elastic File
System (EFS) does.

Documentation team structure
============================

The Documentation project provides documentation for various OpenStack
projects to promote OpenStack, develop and maintain tools and processes
to ensure quality and accuracy of documentation.

The OpenStack community has the following documentation subteams
with their respective leads:

* :doc:`api-site <api-guides>`: *vacant*
* `Contributor Guide
  <https://docs.openstack.org/contributors/>`_:
  Mike Perez
* `Security Guide
  <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Documentation/SecurityGuide>`_:
  Luke Hinds
* `Training Guides <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Training-guides>`_:
  Matjaz Pancur
* `Training labs
  <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Documentation/training-labs>`_:
  Pranav Salunke, Roger Luethi

The current list of docs cores for openstack-manuals, openstackdocstheme,
and openstack-doc-tools repositories can be found at
https://review.openstack.org/#/admin/groups/30,members.

The api-site, contributor-guide, docs-specs, security-doc, training-guides,
and training-labs repositories have separate core teams but also include the
openstack-manuals core team.

The docs-specs repository has a separate core team, see
:doc:`blueprints-and-specs` for details.

The cross-project liaisons (CPLs) assist with subject matter questions,
reviews, doc bug triaging, and patching docs.
Refer to `documentation cross-project liaisons
<https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/CrossProjectLiaisons#Documentation>`_
for the list of people, and if you are interested in becoming a CPL
for docs, contact the Documentation PTL.

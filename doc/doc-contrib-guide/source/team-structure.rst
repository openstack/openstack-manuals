to ensure quality and accuracy of documentation.

The OpenStack community has the following documentation subteams
with their respective leads:

* :doc:`API <api-guides>`: Anne Gentle

  <https://docs.openstack.org/contributors/>`_:
  Mike Perez

The current list of docs cores for openstack-manuals, openstackdocstheme,
and openstack-doc-tools repositories can be found at
https://review.openstack.org/#/admin/groups/30,members.
The api-site, docs-specs, security-doc, training-guides, and training-labs
repositories have separate core teams.

The cross-project liaisons (CPLs) assist with subject matter questions,
reviews, doc bug triaging, and patching docs.
Refer to `documentation cross-project liaisons

There are many tools you can use to create a diagram,
and contributors are free to use the tool of their choice.

However, elements within a diagram must be easily edited or
easy to reproduce with a different tool. Follow the file saving
conventions outlined in :ref:`dg_files`.
This ensures that a diagram can be reviewed and edited as OpenStack
projects continue to change.

Open source tools can help streamline the review process by making
diagrams easy to edit. Many open-source tools contain shapes and
stencils that can be used in OpenStack. The following is a list of
recommended open-source tools:

* `Draw.io <https://www.draw.io/>`_: Draw.io contains most of the
  customization options needed to make diagrams. Diagrams can also
  be saved as a ``.svg`` file, which allows contributors to edit
  individual elements of each diagram.

.. I have left this space for other contributors to recommend
   any other open source diagram tools.

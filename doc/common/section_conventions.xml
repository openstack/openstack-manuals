      </para>
      <note>
        <para>
          This is a note. The information in a note is usually in the form
          of a handy tip or reminder.
        </para>
      </note>
      <important>
        <para>
          This is important. The information in an important admonition is
          something you must be aware of before moving on.
        </para>
      </important>
      <warning>
        <para>
          This is a warning. The information in warnings is critical.
          Warnings provide additional information about risk of data loss or
          security issues.

        available.

        Commands prefixed with the <literal>$</literal> prompt can be
        executed by any user, including <literal>root</literal>.

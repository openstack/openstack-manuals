    <title>External authentication with Identity</title>
    <para>When Identity runs in <literal>apache-httpd</literal>, you
        can use external authentication methods that differ from the
        authentication provided by the identity store back end. For
        example, you can use an SQL identity back end together with
        X.509 authentication, Kerberos, and so on instead of using the
        user name and password combination.</para>

        <title>Use HTTPD authentication</title>
        <para>Web servers, like Apache HTTP, support many methods of
            authentication. Identity can allow the web server to
            perform the authentication. The web server then passes the
            authenticated user to Identity by using the
                <literal>REMOTE_USER</literal> environment variable.
            This user must already exist in the Identity back end to
            get a token from the controller. To use this method,
            Identity should run on
            <literal>apache-httpd</literal>.</para>

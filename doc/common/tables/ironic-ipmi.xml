        <td>(IntOpt) Minimum time, in seconds, between IPMI operations sent to a server. There is a risk with some hardware that setting this too low may cause the BMC to crash. Recommended setting is 5 seconds.</td>

        <td><option>retry_timeout</option> = <replaceable>60</replaceable></td>
        <td>(IntOpt) Maximum time in seconds to retry IPMI operations. There is a tradeoff when setting this value. Setting this too low may cause older BMCs to crash and require a hard reset. However, setting too high can cause the sync power state periodic task to hang when there are slow or unresponsive BMCs.</td>

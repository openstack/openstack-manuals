        <td><option>admin_endpoint</option> = <replaceable>None</replaceable></td>
        <td>(StrOpt) The base admin endpoint URL for Keystone that is advertised to clients (NOTE: this does NOT affect how Keystone listens for connections). Defaults to the base host URL of the request. E.g. a request to http://server:35357/v3/users will default to http://server:35357. You should only need to set this value if the base URL contains a path (e.g. /prefix/v3) or the endpoint should be found on a different server.</td>

      <tr>
        <td><option>admin_port</option> = <replaceable>35357</replaceable></td>

      <tr>
        <td><option>admin_token</option> = <replaceable>ADMIN</replaceable></td>
        <td>(StrOpt) A "shared secret" that can be used to bootstrap Keystone. This "token" does not represent a user, and carries no explicit authorization. To disable in production (highly recommended), remove AdminTokenAuthMiddleware from your paste application pipelines (for example, in keystone-paste.ini).</td>

      <tr>
        <td><option>admin_workers</option> = <replaceable>None</replaceable></td>

        <td><option>compute_port</option> = <replaceable>8774</replaceable></td>
        <td>(IntOpt) (Deprecated) The port which the OpenStack Compute service listens on. This option was only used for string replacement in the templated catalog backend. Templated catalogs should replace the "$(compute_port)s" substitution with the static port of the compute service. As of Juno, this option is deprecated and will be removed in the L release.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><option>domain_id_immutable</option> = <replaceable>True</replaceable></td>
        <td>(BoolOpt) Set this to false if you want to enable the ability for user, group and project entities to be moved between domains by updating their domain_id. Allowing such movement is not recommended if the scope of a domain admin is being restricted by use of an appropriate policy file (see policy.v3cloudsample as an example).</td>

        <td><option>list_limit</option> = <replaceable>None</replaceable></td>
        <td>(IntOpt) The maximum number of entities that will be returned in a collection, with no limit set by default. This global limit may be then overridden for a specific driver, by specifying a list_limit in the appropriate section (e.g. [assignment]).</td>

        <td><option>max_token_size</option> = <replaceable>8192</replaceable></td>

        <td>(StrOpt) Similar to the member_role_name option, this represents the default role ID used to associate users with their default projects in the v2 API. This will be used as the explicit role where one is not specified by the v2 API.</td>

        <td>(StrOpt) The base public endpoint URL for Keystone that is advertised to clients (NOTE: this does NOT affect how Keystone listens for connections). Defaults to the base host URL of the request. E.g. a request to http://server:5000/v3/users will default to http://server:5000. You should only need to set this value if the base URL contains a path (e.g. /prefix/v3) or the endpoint should be found on a different server.</td>

        <td><option>strict_password_check</option> = <replaceable>False</replaceable></td>
        <td>(BoolOpt) If set to true, strict password length checking is performed for password manipulation. If a password exceeds the maximum length, the operation will fail with an HTTP 403 Forbidden error. If set to false, passwords are automatically truncated to the maximum length.</td>

      <tr>
        <td><option>tcp_keepalive</option> = <replaceable>False</replaceable></td>
        <td>(BoolOpt) Set this to true if you want to enable TCP_KEEPALIVE on server sockets, i.e. sockets used by the Keystone wsgi server for client connections.</td>

      <tr>
        <td><option>tcp_keepidle</option> = <replaceable>600</replaceable></td>

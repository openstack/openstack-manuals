    <title>Overview</title>
    <para>
      Each OpenStack project provides a command-line client, which
      enables you to access the project API through easy-to-use
      commands. For example, the Compute service provides a nova
      command-line client.</para>
    <para>
      You can run the commands from the command line, or include the
      commands within scripts to automate tasks. If you provide
      OpenStack credentials, such as your user name and password, you
      can run these commands on any computer.
    </para>
    <para>
      Internally, each command uses cURL command-line tools, which embed
      API requests. OpenStack APIs are RESTful APIs, and use the HTTP
      protocol. They include methods, URIs, media types, and response
      codes.</para>
    <para>
      OpenStack APIs are open-source Python clients, and can run on
      Linux or Mac OS X systems. On some client commands, you can
      specify a <command>debug</command> parameter to show the
      underlying API request for the command. This is a good way to
      become familiar with the OpenStack API calls.</para>
    <para>The following table lists the command-line client for each
      OpenStack service with its package name and description.</para>

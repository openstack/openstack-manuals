    <title>Introduction to Object Storage</title>
    <para>OpenStack Object Storage (code-named swift) is open source software for creating
        redundant, scalable data storage using clusters of standardized servers to store petabytes
        of accessible data. It is a long-term storage system for large amounts of static data that
        can be retrieved, leveraged, and updated. Object Storage uses a distributed architecture
        with no central point of control, providing greater scalability, redundancy, and permanence.
        Objects are written to multiple hardware devices, with the OpenStack software responsible
        for ensuring data replication and integrity across the cluster. Storage clusters scale
        horizontally by adding new nodes. Should a node fail, OpenStack works to replicate its
        content from other active nodes. Because OpenStack uses software logic to ensure data
        replication and distribution across different devices, inexpensive commodity hard drives and
        servers can be used in lieu of more expensive equipment.</para>
    <para>Object Storage is ideal for cost effective, scale-out storage. It provides a fully
        distributed, API-accessible storage platform that can be integrated directly into
        applications or used for backup, archiving, and data retention.</para>

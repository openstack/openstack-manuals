      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis>You cannot use OpenStack Object Storage like a
            traditional hard drive.</emphasis> The Object Storage relaxes some
            of the constraints of a POSIX-style file system to get other gains.
            You can access the objects through an API which uses HTTP.
            Subsequently you don't have to provide atomic operations (that is,
            relying on eventual consistency), you can scale a storage system
            easily and avoid a central point of failure.</para>

      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis>The OpenStack Image Service is used to manage
            the virtual machine images in an OpenStack cluster, not
            store them.</emphasis> It provides an abstraction to different
            methods for storage - a bridge to the storage, not the storage
            itself.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis>The OpenStack Object Storage can function on its
            own.</emphasis> The Object Storage (swift) product can be
          used independently of the Compute (nova) product.</para>

      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis>OpenStack Object Storage is not used like a
            traditional hard drive.</emphasis> Object storage is all
          about relaxing some of the constraints of a POSIX-style file
          system. The access to it is API-based (and the API uses
          http). This is a good idea as if you don't have to provide
          atomic operations (that is, you can rely on eventual
          consistency), you can much more easily scale a storage
          system and avoid a central point of failure.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis>The OpenStack Image Service is used to manage
            the virtual machine images in an OpenStack cluster, not
            store them.</emphasis> Instead, it provides an
          abstraction to different methods for storage - a bridge to
          the storage, not the storage itself.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis>OpenStack Object Storage can function on its
            own.</emphasis> The Object Storage (swift) product can be
          used independently of the Compute (nova) product.</para>

    <title>Evacuate instances</title>
    <para>If a cloud compute node fails due to a hardware malfunction or another reason, you can
        evacuate instances to make them available again. You can choose evacuation parameters for
        your use case.</para>
    <para>To preserve user data on server disk, you must configure shared storage on the target
        host. Also, you must validate that the current VM host is down; otherwise, the evacuation
        fails with an error.</para>
    <procedure xml:id="evacuate_shared">
        <step>
            <para>To list hosts and find a different host for the evacuated instance, run:</para>
            <screen><prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>nova host-list</userinput></screen>
        </step>
        <step>
            <para>Evacuate the instance. You can pass the instance password to the command by using
                the <literal>--password &lt;pwd&gt;</literal> option. If you do not specify a
                password, one is generated and printed after the command finishes successfully. The
                following command evacuates a server without shared storage from a host that is down
                to the specified <replaceable>host_b</replaceable>:</para>
            <screen><prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>nova evacuate <replaceable>evacuated_server_name</replaceable> <replaceable>host_b</replaceable></userinput> </screen>
            <para>The instance is booted from a new disk, but preserves its configuration including
                its ID, name, uid, IP address, and so on. The command returns a password:</para>
            <screen><computeroutput><?db-font-size 70%?>+-----------+--------------+
| Property  |    Value     |
+-----------+--------------+
| adminPass | kRAJpErnT4xZ |
+-----------+--------------+</computeroutput></screen>
        </step>
        <step>
            <para>To preserve the user disk data on the evacuated server, deploy OpenStack Compute
                with a shared file system. To configure your system, see <link
                    xlink:href="http://docs.openstack.org/admin-guide-cloud/content/section_configuring-compute-migrations.html"
                    >Configure migrations</link> in <citetitle>OpenStack Cloud Administrator
                    Guide</citetitle>. In the following example, the password remains
                unchanged:</para>
            <screen><prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>nova evacuate <replaceable>evacuated_server_name</replaceable> <replaceable>host_b</replaceable> --on-shared-storage</userinput>    </screen>
        </step>
    </procedure>

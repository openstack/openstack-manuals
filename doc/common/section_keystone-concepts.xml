    <title>OpenStack Identity concepts</title>
    <para>The OpenStack<glossterm>Identity Service</glossterm> performs the
           following functions:</para>
    <itemizedlist spacing="compact">
        <listitem>
            <para>Tracking users and their permissions.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>Providing a catalog of available services with their API
                  endpoints.</para>
        </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>When installing OpenStack Identity service, you must register
          each service in your OpenStack installation. Identity service
          can then track which OpenStack services are installed, and
          where they are located on the network.</para>
    <para>To understand OpenStack Identity, you must understand the
          following concepts:</para>
    <variablelist>
        <varlistentry>
            <term>User</term>
            <listitem>
                <para>Digital representation of a person, system, or
                    service who uses OpenStack cloud services. The
                    Identity service validates that incoming requests
                    are made by the user who claims to be making the
                    call. Users have a login and may be assigned
                    tokens to access resources. Users can be directly
                    assigned to a particular tenant and behave as if
                    they are contained in that tenant.</para>
            </listitem>
        </varlistentry>
        <varlistentry>
            <term>Credentials</term>
            <listitem>
                <para>Data that confirms the user's identity. For
                    example: user name and password, user name and API
                    key, or an authentication token provided by the
                    Identity Service.</para>
            </listitem>
        </varlistentry>
        <varlistentry>
            <term>Authentication</term>
            <listitem>
                <para>The process of confirming the identity of a user.
                    OpenStack Identity confirms an incoming request
                    by validating a set of credentials supplied by the
                    user.</para>
                <para>These credentials are initially a user name and
                    password, or a user name and API key. When user
                    credentials are validated, OpenStack Identity issues an
                    authentication token which the user provides in subsequent
                    requests.</para>
            </listitem>
        </varlistentry>
        <varlistentry>
            <term>Token</term>
            <listitem>
                <para>An alpha-numeric string of text used to access
                    OpenStack APIs and resources. A token  may be
                    revoked at any time and is valid for a
                    finite duration.</para>
                <para>While OpenStack Identity supports token-based
                    authentication in this release, the intention is
                    to support additional protocols in the future.
                    Its main purpose is to be an integration service,
                    and not aspire to be a full-fledged identity store
                    and management solution.</para>

        </varlistentry>
        <varlistentry>
            <term>Tenant</term>
            <listitem>
                <para>A container used to group or isolate resources.
                    Tenants also group or isolate identity objects.
                    Depending on the service operator, a tenant may map
                    to a customer, account, organization, or project.</para>
            </listitem>
        </varlistentry>
        <varlistentry>
            <term>Service</term>
            <listitem>
                <para>An OpenStack service, such as Compute (nova),
                    Object Storage (swift), or Image Service (glance).
                    It provides one or more endpoints in which
                    users can access resources and perform operations.</para>
            </listitem>
        </varlistentry>
        <varlistentry>
            <term>Endpoint</term>
            <listitem>
                <para>A network-accessible address where you access a service,
                    usually a URL address. If you are using an extension for
                    templates, an endpoint template can be created, which
                    represents the templates of all the consumable services
                    that are available across the regions.</para>

            <term>Role</term>
            <listitem>
                <para>A personality with a defined set of user rights and
                    privileges to perform a specific set of operations.</para>
                <para>In the Identity service, a token that is issued
                    to a user includes the list of roles. Services that are
                    being called by that user determine how they interpret the
                    set of roles a user has and to which operations or
                    resources each role grants access.</para>

            <listitem>
                <para>A command line interface for the OpenStack
                    Identity API. For example, users can run the
                    <command>keystone service-create</command> and
                    <command>keystone endpoint-create</command> commands
                    to register services in their OpenStack
                    installations.</para>

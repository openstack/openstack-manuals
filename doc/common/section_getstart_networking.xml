  <title>Networking service overview</title>
  <para>Provides network-connectivity-as-a-service between interface
    devices that are managed by other OpenStack services, usually
    Compute. Enables users to create and attach interfaces to
    networks. Like many OpenStack services, OpenStack Networking is
    highly configurable due to its plug-in architecture. These
    plug-ins accommodate different networking equipment and software.
    Consequently, the architecture and deployment vary
    dramatically.</para>
  <para>Includes the following components:</para>
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para><systemitem class="service">neutron-server</systemitem>.
        Accepts and routes API requests to the appropriate OpenStack
        Networking plug-in for action.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>OpenStack Networking plug-ins and agents. Plugs and
        unplugs ports, creates networks or subnets, and provides IP
        addressing. These plug-ins and agents differ depending on the
        vendor and technologies used in the particular cloud.
        OpenStack Networking ships with plug-ins and agents for Cisco
        virtual and physical switches, NEC OpenFlow products, Open
        vSwitch, Linux bridging, Ryu Network Operating System, and
        the VMware NSX product.</para>
      <para>The common agents are L3 (layer 3), DHCP (dynamic host IP
        addressing), and a plug-in agent.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>Messaging queue. Most OpenStack Networking installations
        make use of a messaging queue to route information between the
        neutron-server and various agents as well as a database to
        store networking state for particular plug-ins.</para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  <para>OpenStack Networking interacts mainly with OpenStack Compute,
    where it provides networks and connectivity for its
    instances.</para>

  <title>OpenStack Networking</title>
  <para>OpenStack Networking allows you to create and
    attach interface devices managed by other OpenStack services to
    networks. Plug-ins can be implemented to accomodate different
    networking equipment and software, providing flexibility to OpenStack
    architecture and deployment.</para>
  <para>It includes the following components:</para>
  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry><term><systemitem
          class="service">neutron-server</systemitem></term>
        <listitem><para>Accepts and routes API requests to the appropriate
         OpenStack Networking plug-in for action.</para></listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>OpenStack Networking plug-ins and agents</term>
        <listitem><para>Plugs and unplugs ports, creates networks or subnets,
        and provides IP  addressing. These plug-ins and agents differ
        depending on the vendor and technologies used in the particular cloud.
        OpenStack Networking ships with plug-ins and agents for Cisco
        virtual and physical switches, NEC OpenFlow products, Open
        vSwitch, Linux bridging, Ryu Network Operating System, and
        the VMware NSX product.</para>
      <para>The common agents are L3 (layer 3), DHCP (dynamic host IP
        addressing), and a plug-in agent.</para></listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Messaging queue</term>
      <listitem><para>Used by most OpenStack Networking installations to route
        information between the neutron-server and various agents, as well as a
        database to store networking state for particular
        plug-ins.</para></listitem>
    </varlistentry>
  </variablelist>
  <para>OpenStack Networking mainly interacts with OpenStack Compute to
       provide networks and connectivity for its instances.</para>

    <title>Troubleshoot the Identity service</title>
    <para>To troubleshoot the Identity service, review the logs in the
            <filename>/var/log/keystone/keystone.log</filename> file.</para>
    <note>
        <para>Use the <filename>/etc/keystone/logging.conf</filename>
            file to configure the location of log files.</para>
    </note>
    <para>The logs show the components that have come in to the WSGI
        request, and ideally show an error that explains why an
        authorization request failed. If you do not see the request in
        the logs, run keystone with <parameter>--debug</parameter>
        parameter. Pass the <parameter>--debug</parameter> parameter
        before the command parameters.</para>

        <para>If you receive an <literal>Invalid OpenStack Identity
                Credentials</literal> message when you talk to an
            OpenStack service, it might be caused by the changeover
            from UUID tokens to PKI tokens in the Grizzly release.
            Learn how to troubleshoot this error.</para>
        <para>The PKI-based token validation scheme relies on
            certificates from Identity that are fetched through HTTP
            and stored in a local directory. The location for this
            directory is specified by the
                <literal>signing_dir</literal> configuration option.
            In your services configuration file, look for a section
            like this:</para>
        <programlisting language="ini">[keystone_authtoken]
signing_dir = /var/cache/glance/api
auth_uri = http://127.0.0.1:5000/
auth_host = 127.0.0.1
auth_port = 35357
auth_protocol = http
admin_tenant_name = service
admin_user = glance</programlisting>
        <para>If your service lacks this stanza, the <link
                xlink:href="https://github.com/openstack/python-keystoneclient/blob/master/keystoneclient/middleware/auth_token.py#L198"
                >keystoneclient/middleware/auth_token.py</link> file
            specifies the defaults. If no value is specified for this
            directory, it <link
                xlink:href="https://github.com/openstack/python-keystoneclient/blob/master/keystoneclient/middleware/auth_token.py#L299"
                >defaults to a secure temporary directory.</link>
            Initialization code for the service checks that the
            directory exists and is writable. If it does not exist,
            the code tries to create it. If this fails, the service
            fails to start. However, it often succeeds but problems
            occur later.</para>
        <para>The first thing to check is that the
                <literal>signing_dir</literal> does, in fact, exist.
            If it does, check for the presence of the certificate
            files inside there:</para>

        <para>This directory contains two certificates and the token
            revocation list. If these files are not present, your
            service cannot fetch them from Identity. To troubleshoot,
            try to talk to Identity to make sure it correctly serves
            files, as follows:</para>
        <screen><prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>curl http://localhost:35357/v2.0/certificates/signing</userinput></screen>
        <para>This command fetches the signing certificate:</para>
        <programlisting>Certificate:
    Data:
        Version: 3 (0x2)
        Serial Number: 1 (0x1)

            Not After : Jul 20 14:57:31 2023 GMT
        Subject: C=US, ST=Unset, O=Unset, CN=www.example.com</programlisting>
        <para>Note the expiration dates of the certificate:</para>
        <programlisting>Not Before: Jul 22 14:57:31 2013 GMT
Not After : Jul 20 14:57:31 2023 GMT</programlisting>
        <para>The token revocation list is updated once a minute, but
            the certificates are not. One possible problem is that the
            certificates are the wrong files or garbage. You can
            remove these files and run another command against your
            server: They are fetched on demand.</para>
        <para>The Identity service log should show the access of the
            certificate files. You might have to turn up your logging
            levels. Set <literal>debug = True</literal> and
                <literal>verbose = True</literal> in your Identity
            configuration file and restart the Identity server.</para>

        </itemizedlist>
        <para>SELinux troubles often occur when you use
            Fedora/RHEL-based packages and you choose configuration
            options that do not match the standard policy. Run the
                <command>setenforce permissive</command> command. If
            that makes a difference, you should relabel the directory.
            If you are using a sub-directory of the
                <filename>/var/cache/</filename> directory, run the
            following command:</para>
        <screen><prompt>#</prompt> <userinput>restorecon /var/cache/</userinput></screen>
        <para>If you are not using a <filename>/var/cache</filename>
            sub-directory, you should. Modify the
                <literal>signing_dir</literal> configuration option
            for your service and restart.</para>
        <para>Set back to <literal>setenforce enforcing</literal> to
            confirm that your changes solve the problem.</para>
        <para>If your certificates are fetched on demand, the PKI
            validation is working properly. Most likely, the token
            from Identity is not valid for the operation you are
            attempting to perform, and your user needs a different
            role for the operation.</para>

            user. When you run the <command>keystone-manage

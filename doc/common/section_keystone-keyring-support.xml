  <title>Keyring support</title>
  <para>Keyring is a password management system available in OpenStack.
    You can install it using the following command:</para>
  <screen><prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>pip install keyring</userinput></screen>
  <note>
    <para>Keyring is used only if <parameter>--os-use-keyring</parameter>
      is specified or if the environment variable
      <option>OS_USE_KEYRING=true</option> is defined.</para>
  </note>
  <para>A user specifies their username and password credentials to interact
    with OpenStack, using any client command. These credentials can be specified
    using various mechanisms, namely, the environment variable, or command line argument.
    It is not safe to specify the password using either of these methods.</para>
  <para>For example, when you specify your password using the command-line client
    with the <parameter>--os-password</parameter> argument, anyone with access
    to your computer can view it in plain text with the <literal>ps</literal>
    field.</para>
  <para>To avoid storing the password in plain text, you can prompt for the
    OpenStack password interactively. Then, the keyring can store the password
    and the user can safely retrieve it from their keyring. The encrypted password
    is stored in the <filename>~/.openstack-keyring.cfg</filename> file.</para>

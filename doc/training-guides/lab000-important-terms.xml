    <title>Host Operating System (Host)</title>
    <para>The operating system that is installed on your laptop or
      desktop that hosts virtual machines. Commonly referred to as
        host OS or <glossterm>host</glossterm>.
      In short, the machine where your Virtual Box is
      installed.</para>
  </formalpara>
  <formalpara>
    <title>Guest Operating System (Guest)</title>
    <para>The operating system that is installed on your Virtual Box
      Virtual Machine. This virtual instance is independent of the
      host OS. Commonly referred to as <glossterm>guest OS</glossterm>
      or guest.</para>
  </formalpara>
  <formalpara>
    <title>Node</title>
    <para>In this context, refers specifically to servers. Each
      OpenStack server is a node.</para>
  </formalpara>
  <formalpara>
    <title>Control Node</title>
    <para>Hosts the database, Keystone (Middleware), and the servers
      for the scope of the current OpenStack deployment. Acts as the
      brains behind OpenStack and drives services such as
      authentication, database, and so on.</para>
  </formalpara>
  <formalpara>
    <title>Compute Node</title>
    <para>Has the required Hypervisor (Qemu/KVM) and is your Virtual
      Machine host.</para>
  </formalpara>
  <formalpara>
    <title>Network Node</title>
    <para>Provides Network-as-a-Service and virtual networks for
      OpenStack.</para>
  </formalpara>
  <formalpara>
    <title>Using OpenSSH</title>
    <para>After you set up the network interfaces file, you can switch
      to an SSH session by using an OpenSSH client to log in remotely
      to the required server node (Control, Network, Compute). Open a
      terminal on your host machine. Run the following command:
      <screen><prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>ssh-keygen -t rsa</userinput>
<computeroutput>Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/u/kim/.ssh/id_rsa): [RETURN]
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): &lt;can be left empty>
Enter same passphrase again: &lt;can be left empty>
Your identification has been saved in /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
b7:18:ad:3b:0b:50:5c:e1:da:2d:6f:5b:65:82:94:c5 xyz@example</computeroutput></screen>

  <title>VM Placement</title>
  <para>Compute uses the nova-scheduler service to determine how to
    dispatch compute and volume requests. For example, the
    nova-scheduler service determines which host a VM should launch
    on. The term host in the context of filters means a physical node
    that has a <systemitem class="service">nova-compute</systemitem>
    service running on it. You can configure the scheduler through a
    variety of options.</para>

  <para>Just as shown by above figure, nova-scheduler interacts with
    other components through queue and central database repo. For
    scheduling, queue is the essential communications hub.</para>
  <para>All compute nodes (also known as hosts in terms of OpenStack)
    periodically publish their status, resources available and
    hardware capabilities to nova-scheduler through the queue.
    nova-scheduler then collects this data and uses it to make
    decisions when a request comes in.</para>
  <para>By default, the compute scheduler is configured as a filter
    scheduler, as described in the next section. In the default
    configuration, this scheduler considers hosts that meet all the
    following criteria:</para>
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>Are in the requested availability zone
        (AvailabilityZoneFilter).</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>Have sufficient RAM available (RamFilter).</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>Are capable of servicing the request
        (ComputeFilter).</para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

    <para><guilabel>Filter Scheduler</guilabel></para>
    <para>The Filter Scheduler supports filtering and weighting to
    make informed decisions on where a new instance should be created.
    This Scheduler supports only working with Compute Nodes.</para>

      <para>During its work, Filter Scheduler first makes a dictionary
        of unfiltered hosts, then filters them using filter properties
        and finally chooses hosts for the requested number of
        instances (each time it chooses the most weighed host and
        appends it to the list of selected hosts).</para>
      <para>If it turns up, that it can’t find candidates for the next
        instance, it means that there are no more appropriate hosts
        where the instance could be scheduled.</para>
      <para>If we speak about filtering and weighting, their work is
        quite flexible in the Filter Scheduler. There are a lot of
        filtering strategies for the Scheduler to support. Also you
        can even implement your own algorithm of filtering.</para>
      <para>There are some standard filter classes to use
        (nova.scheduler.filters):</para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>AllHostsFilter - frankly speaking, this filter does no
            operation. It passes all the available hosts.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>ImagePropertiesFilter - filters hosts based on
            properties defined on the instance’s image. It passes
            hosts that can support the specified image properties
            contained in the instance.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>AvailabilityZoneFilter - filters hosts by availability
            zone. It passes hosts matching the availability zone
            specified in the instance properties.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>ComputeCapabilitiesFilter - checks that the
            capabilities provided by the host Compute service satisfy
            any extra specifications associated with the instance
            type. It passes hosts that can create the specified
            instance type.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>The extra specifications can have a scope at the
            beginning of the key string of a key/value pair. The scope
            format is scope:key and can be nested, i.e. key_string :=
            scope:key_string. Example like capabilities:cpu_info:
            features is valid scope format. A key string without any :
            is non-scope format. Each filter defines its valid scope,
            and not all filters accept non-scope format.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>The extra specifications can have an operator at the
            beginning of the value string of a key/value pair. If
            there is no operator specified, then a default operator of
            s== is used. Valid operators are:</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      <para>* = (equal to or greater than as a number; same as vcpus
        case)* == (equal to as a number)* != (not equal to as a
        number)* &gt;= (greater than or equal to as a number)* &lt;=
        (less than or equal to as a number)* s== (equal to as a
        string)* s!= (not equal to as a string)* s&gt;= (greater than
        or equal to as a string)* s&gt; (greater than as a string)*
        s&lt;= (less than or equal to as a string)* s&lt; (less than
        as a string)* &lt;in&gt; (substring)* &lt;or&gt; (find one of
        these)Examples are: "&gt;= 5", "s== 2.1.0", "&lt;in&gt; gcc",
        and "&lt;or&gt; fpu &lt;or&gt; gpu"</para>
      <programlisting>class RamFilter(filters.BaseHostFilter):
  """Ram Filter with over subscription flag"""

  def host_passes(self, host_state, filter_properties):
  """Only return hosts with sufficient available RAM."""

    instance_type = filter_properties.get('instance_type')
    requested_ram = instance_type['memory_mb']
    free_ram_mb = host_state.free_ram_mb
    total_usable_ram_mb = host_state.total_usable_ram_mb
    used_ram_mb = total_usable_ram_mb - free_ram_mb
    return total_usable_ram_mb * FLAGS.ram_allocation_ratio - used_ram_mb >= requested_ram</programlisting>
      <para>Here ram_allocation_ratio means the virtual RAM to
        physical RAM allocation ratio (it is 1.5 by default). Really,
        nice and simple.</para>
      <para>Next standard filter to describe is AvailabilityZoneFilter
        and it isn’t difficult too. This filter just looks at the
        availability zone of compute node and availability zone from
        the properties of the request. Each Compute service has its
        own availability zone. So deployment engineers have an option
        to run scheduler with availability zones support and can
        configure availability zones on each compute host. This
        classes method host_passes returns True if availability zone
        mentioned in request is the same on the current compute
        host.</para>
      <para>The ImagePropertiesFilter filters hosts based on the
        architecture, hypervisor type, and virtual machine mode
        specified in the instance. E.g., an instance might require a
        host that supports the arm architecture on a qemu compute
        host. The ImagePropertiesFilter will only pass hosts that can
        satisfy this request. These instance properties are populated
        from properties define on the instance’s image. E.g. an image
        can be decorated with these properties using glance
        image-update img-uuid --property architecture=arm --property
        hypervisor_type=qemu Only hosts that satisfy these
        requirements will pass the ImagePropertiesFilter.</para>
      <para>ComputeCapabilitiesFilter checks if the host satisfies any
        extra_specs specified on the instance type. The extra_specs
        can contain key/value pairs. The key for the filter is either
        non-scope format (i.e. no : contained), or scope format in
        capabilities scope (i.e. capabilities:xxx:yyy). One example of
        capabilities scope is capabilities:cpu_info:features, which
        will match host’s cpu features capabilities. The
        ComputeCapabilitiesFilter will only pass hosts whose
        capabilities satisfy the requested specifications. All hosts
        are passed if no extra_specs are specified.</para>
      <para>ComputeFilter is quite simple and passes any host whose
        Compute service is enabled and operational.</para>
      <para>Now we are going to IsolatedHostsFilter. There can be some
        special hosts reserved for specific images. These hosts are
        called isolated. So the images to run on the isolated hosts
        are also called isolated. This Scheduler checks if
        image_isolated flag named in instance specifications is the
        same that the host has.</para>

    <para><guilabel>Weights</guilabel></para>
    <para>Filter Scheduler uses so-called weights during its
      work.</para>
    <para>The Filter Scheduler weights hosts based on the config
      option scheduler_weight_classes, this defaults to
      nova.scheduler.weights.all_weighers, which selects the only
      weigher available – the RamWeigher. Hosts are then weighted and
      sorted with the largest weight winning.</para>
    <para>Filter Scheduler finds local list of acceptable hosts by
      repeated filtering and weighing. Each time it chooses a host, it
      virtually consumes resources on it, so subsequent selections can
      adjust accordingly. It is useful if the customer asks for the
      same large amount of instances, because weight is computed for
      each instance requested.</para>

    <para>In the end Filter Scheduler sorts selected hosts by their
      weight and provisions instances on them.</para>

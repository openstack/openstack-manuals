    <title>Ceph RADOS Block Device (RBD)</title>

    <para>If you use KVM or QEMU as your hypervisor, you can configure
        the Compute service to use <link

            Ceph RADOS block devices (RBD)</link> for volumes.</para>
    <para>Ceph is a massively scalable, open source, distributed
        storage system. It is comprised of an object store, block
        store, and a POSIX-compliant distributed file system. The
        platform can auto-scale to the exabyte level and beyond. It
        runs on commodity hardware, is self-healing and self-managing,
        and has no single point of failure. Ceph is in the Linux
        kernel and is integrated with the OpenStack cloud operating
        system. Due to its open source nature, you can install and use
        this portable storage platform in public or private clouds. <figure>

        <para>You can easily get confused by the naming: Ceph?
            RADOS?</para>
        <para><emphasis>RADOS: Reliable Autonomic Distributed Object
                Store</emphasis> is an object store. RADOS distributes
            objects across the storage cluster and replicates objects
            for fault tolerance. RADOS contains the following major
            components:</para>
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para><emphasis>Object Storage Device
                    (OSD)</emphasis>. The storage daemon - RADOS
                    service, the location of your data. You must run
                    this daemon on each server in your cluster. For
                    each OSD, you can have an associated hard drive
                    disk. For performance purposes, pool your hard
                    drive disk with raid arrays, logical volume
                    management (LVM) or B-tree file system (Btrfs)
                    pooling. By default, the following pools are
                    created: data, metadata, and RBD.</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para><emphasis>Meta-Data Server (MDS)</emphasis>.
                    Stores metadata. MDSs build a POSIX file system on
                    top of objects for Ceph clients. However, if you
                    do not use the Ceph file system, you do not need a
                    metadata server.</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para><emphasis>Monitor (MON)</emphasis>. This
                    lightweight daemon handles all communications with
                    external applications and clients. It also
                    provides a consensus for distributed decision
                    making in a Ceph/RADOS cluster. For instance, when
                    you mount a Ceph shared on a client, you point to
                    the address of a MON server. It checks the state
                    and the consistency of the data. In an ideal
                    setup, you must run at least three
                        <code>ceph-mon</code> daemons on separate
                    servers.</para>

        <para>Ceph developers recommend that you use Btrfs as a file
            system for storage. XFS might be a better alternative for
            production environments. Neither Ceph nor Btrfs is ready
            for production and it could be risky to use them in
            combination. XFS is an excellent alternative to Btrfs. The
            ext4 file system is also compatible but does not exploit
            the power of Ceph.</para>
        <note>
            <para>Currently, configure Ceph to use the XFS file
                system. Use Btrfs when it is stable enough for
                production.</para>

        <title>Ways to store, use, and expose data</title>
        <para>To store and access your data, you can use the following

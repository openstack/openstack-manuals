        <title>Ceph backup driver</title>
        <para>The Ceph backup driver backs up volumes of any type to a
                Ceph back-end store. The driver can also detect
                whether the volume to be backed up is a Ceph RBD
                volume, and if so, it tries to perform incremental and
                differential backups.</para>
        <para>For source Ceph RBD volumes, you can perform backups
                within the same Ceph pool (not recommended) and
                backups between different Ceph pools and between
                different Ceph clusters.</para>
        <para>At the time of writing, differential backup support in
                Ceph/librbd was quite new. This driver attempts a
                differential backup in the first instance. If the
                differential backup fails, the driver falls back to
                full backup/copy.</para>
        <para>If incremental backups are used, multiple backups of the
                same volume are stored as snapshots so that minimal
                space is consumed in the backup store. It takes far
                less time to restore a volume than to take a full
                copy.</para>

                                   The restore action takes a full
                                   copy because this is the safest
                                   action.</para>

Put your name next to a task if you want to work on it and put a WIP
review up on review.openstack.org.

May 20, 2014
To do tasks:
- Add a chapter showing differences from release-to-release of renamed
  and removed options
- Add descriptions that describe why you would set a setting
- Add information about additional options affected (in groups of settings)
- Add audience information; who is this book intended for

Ongoing tasks:
- Ensure it meets conventions and standards
- Continually update with latest reference information including great
  descriptions of options and why you set a setting or groups of
  settings

Wishlist tasks:
- Can distros like Ubuntu produce documented config files?

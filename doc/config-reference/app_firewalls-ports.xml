    <title>Firewalls and default ports</title>
    <para>On some deployments, such as ones where restrictive
        firewalls are in place, you might need to manually configure a
        firewall to permit OpenStack service traffic.</para>
    <para>To manually configure a firewall, you must permit traffic
        through the ports that each OpenStack service uses. This table
        lists the default ports that each OpenStack service
        uses:</para>
    <xi:include href="table_default-ports-primary-services.xml"/>
    <para>To function properly, some OpenStack components depend on
        other, non-OpenStack services. For example, the OpenStack
        dashboard uses HTTP for non-secure communication. In this
        case, you must configure the firewall to allow traffic to and
        from HTTP.</para>
    <para>This table lists the ports that other OpenStack components
        use:</para>
    <xi:include href="table_default-ports-peripheral-services.xml"/>
    <para>On some deployments, the default port used by a service
        may fall within the defined local port range of a host. To
        check a host's local port range:</para>
        <screen><prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>sysctl -a | grep ip_local_port_range</userinput></screen>
        <para>If a service's default port falls within this range, run
        the following program to check if the port has already been
        assigned to another application:</para>
        <screen><prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>lsof -i :<replaceable>PORT</replaceable></userinput></screen>
        <para>Configure the service to use a different port if the
        default port is already being used by another application.</para>

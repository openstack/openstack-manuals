    <title>Cross-origin resource sharing</title>
    <para>Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that allows code running in a browser
        (JavaScript for example) to make requests to a domain, other than the one it was
        originated from. OpenStack Object Storage supports CORS requests to containers and objects within
        the containers using metadata held on the container.</para>
    <para>In addition to the metadata on containers, you can use the
<option>cors_allow_origin</option> option in the
<filename>proxy-server.conf</filename> file to set a list of hosts that
are included with any CORS request by default.</para>

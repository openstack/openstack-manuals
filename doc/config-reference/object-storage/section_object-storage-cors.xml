    <title>Cross-origin resource sharing</title>
    <para>Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a mechanism to allow code
    running in a browser (JavaScript for example) to make requests to a domain
    other then the one from where it originated. Swift supports CORS requests
    to containers and objects within the containers using metadata held on the
    container.
    </para>
    <para>In addition to the metadata on containers, you can use the
<option>cors_allow_origin</option> option in the
<filename>proxy-server.conf</filename> file to set a list of hosts that
are included with any CORS request by default.</para>

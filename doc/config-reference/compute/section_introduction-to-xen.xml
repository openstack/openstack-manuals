            <para>
                A hypervisor that provides the fundamental isolation between
                virtual machines. Xen is open source (GPLv2) and is managed by
                Xen.org, an cross-industry organization and a Linux
                Foundation Collaborative project.

            <para>
                Xen is a component of many different products and projects. The
                hypervisor itself is very similar across all these projects,
                but the way that it is managed can be different, which can
                cause confusion if you're not clear which toolstack you are
                using. Make sure you know what toolstack you want before you
                get started.

                XenAPI is one of the toolstacks that could control a Xen based
                hypervisor. XenAPI's role is similar to libvirt's in the KVM
                world. To learn more about XenAPI, visit the

            <title>Privileged and unprivileged domains</title>
            <para>
                A Xen host runs a number of virtual machines, VMs, or domains
                (the terms are synonymous on Xen). One of these is in charge of
                running the rest of the system, and is known as domain 0, or
                dom0. It is the first domain to boot after Xen, and owns the
                storage and networking hardware, the device drivers, and the
                primary control software. Any other VM is unprivileged, and are
                known as a domU or guest.  All customer VMs are unprivileged,
                but you should note that on Xen, the OpenStack Compute service
                (<systemitem class="service">nova-compute</systemitem>)
                also runs in a domU.  This gives a level of security isolation
                between the privileged system software and the OpenStack
                software (much of which is customer-facing). This architecture
                is described in more detail later.

            <title>Paravirtualized versus hardware virtualized domains</title>
            <para>
                A Xen virtual machine can be paravirtualized (PV) or hardware
                virtualized (HVM). This refers to the interaction between Xen,
                domain 0, and the guest VM's kernel.  PV guests are aware of
                the fact that they are virtualized and will co-operate with Xen
                and domain 0; this gives them better performance
                characteristics. HVM guests are not aware of their environment,
                and the hardware has to pretend that they are running on an
                unvirtualized machine. HVM guests do not need to modify the
                guest operating system, which is essential when running
                Windows.
            </para>
            <para>
                In OpenStack, customer VMs may run in either PV or HVM mode.
                However, the OpenStack domU (that's the one running
                <systemitem class="service">nova-compute</systemitem>) must be
                running in PV mode.

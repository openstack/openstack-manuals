    <title>Scheduling</title>
    <para>Compute uses the <systemitem class="service"
            >nova-scheduler</systemitem> service to determine how to
        dispatch compute requests. For example, the
            <systemitem class="service">nova-scheduler</systemitem>
        service determines on which host a VM should launch. In the
        context of filters, the term <firstterm>host</firstterm> means
        a physical node that has a <systemitem class="service"
            >nova-compute</systemitem> service running on it. You can
        configure the scheduler through a variety of options.</para>
    <para>Compute is configured with the following default scheduler

            is the default scheduler for scheduling virtual machine

        <title>Filters</title>
        <para>When the filter scheduler receives a request for a
            resource, it first applies filters to determine which
            hosts are eligible for consideration when dispatching a
            resource. Filters are binary: either a host is accepted by
            the filter, or it is rejected. Hosts that are accepted by
            the filter are then processed by a different algorithm to
            decide which hosts to use for that request, described in
            the <link linkend="weights">Weights</link> section.</para>

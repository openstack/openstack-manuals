  <title>Configure Compute backing storage</title>
  <para>Backing Storage is the storage used to provide
  the expanded operating system image, and any ephemeral storage.
  Inside the virtual machine, this is normally presented as two
  virtual hard disks (for example, /dev/vda and /dev/vdb respectively).
  However, inside OpenStack, this can be derived from one of three
  methods: LVM, QCOW or RAW, chosen using the
  <literal>libvirt_images_type</literal> option in <filename>nova.conf</filename>
  on the compute node.</para>
  <para>QCOW is the default backing store. It uses a copy-on-write philosophy to
  delay allocation of storage until it is actually needed. This means that the
  space required for the backing of an image can be significantly less on the real
  disk than what seems available in the virtual machine operating system.
 </para>
  <para>RAW creates files without any sort of file formatting, effectively creating
   files with the plain binary one would normally see on a real disk. This can
   increase performance, but means that the entire size of the virtual disk is
   reserved on the physical disk.
 </para>
  <para>Local <link xlink:href="http://http//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_Volume_Manager_(Linux)">LVM volumes</link>
  can also be used.
  Set <literal>libvirt_images_volume_group=nova_local</literal> where <literal>nova_local</literal> is the name
  of the LVM group you have created.

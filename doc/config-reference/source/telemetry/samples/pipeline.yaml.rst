pipeline.yaml
=============

Pipelines describe a coupling between sources of samples and the
corresponding sinks for transformation and publication of the data. They
are defined in the ``pipeline.yaml`` file.

This file can be modified to adjust polling intervals and the samples
generated by the Telemetry module.

   * - ``cleanup_time_for_incomplete_clusters`` = ``0``

     - (Integer) Maximal time (in hours) for clusters allowed to be in states other than "Active", "Deleting" or "Error".

(0 value means that automatic clean up is disabled).

   * - ``cluster_remote_threshold`` = ``70``

   * - ``compute_topology_file`` = ``etc/sahara/compute.topology``

     - (String) File with nova compute topology. It should contain mapping between nova computes and racks.

   * - ``node_domain`` = ``novalocal``

     - (String) The suffix of the node's FQDN. In nova-network that is the dhcp_domain config parameter.

     - (Boolean) Enable periodic tasks.

   * - ``periodic_fuzzy_delay`` = ``60``

     - (Integer) Range in seconds to randomly delay when starting the periodic task scheduler to reduce stampeding. (Disable by setting to 0).

   * - ``periodic_interval_max`` = ``60``

     - (Integer) Max interval size between periodic tasks execution in seconds.

.. list-table:: Description of network configuration options
   :header-rows: 1
   :class: config-ref-table

   * - Configuration option = Default value
     - Description
   * - **[DEFAULT]**
     -
   * - ``allow_same_net_traffic`` = ``True``
     - (Boolean) Determine whether to allow network traffic from same network.

       When set to true, hosts on the same subnet are not filtered and are allowed to pass all types of traffic between them. On a flat network, this allows all instances from all projects unfiltered communication. With VLAN networking, this allows access between instances within the same project.

       This option only applies when using the ``nova-network`` service. When using another networking services, such as Neutron, security groups or other approaches should be used.

       Possible values:

       * True: Network traffic should be allowed pass between all instances on the same network, regardless of their tenant and security policies

       * False: Network traffic should not be allowed pass between instances unless it is unblocked in a security group

       Interdependencies to other options:

       * ``use_neutron``: This must be set to ``False`` to enable ``nova-network`` networking

       * ``firewall_driver``: This must be set to ``nova.virt.libvirt.firewall.IptablesFirewallDriver`` to ensure the libvirt firewall driver is enabled.
   * - ``auto_assign_floating_ip`` = ``False``

       While allocating a floating ip, users can optionally pass in the name of the pool they want to allocate from, otherwise it will be pulled from the default pool.

       If this option is not set, then 'nova' is used as default floating pool.

       Possible values

        A list of strings, where each string is the full path to a dhcpbridge configuration file.
   * - ``dns_server`` = ``[]``

   * - ``ebtables_retry_interval`` = ``1.0``
     - (Floating point) This option determines the time, in seconds, that the system will sleep in between ebtables retries. Note that each successive retry waits a multiple of this value, so for example, if this is set to the default of 1.0 seconds, and ebtables_exec_attempts is 4, after the first failure, the system will sleep for 1

       * 1.0 seconds, after the second failure it will sleep 2

       * 1.0 seconds, and after the third failure it will sleep 3

       * 1.0 seconds.

       Possible values:

       Related options:

       * ebtables_exec_attempts
   * - ``firewall_driver`` = ``None``
     - (String) Firewall driver to use with ``nova-network`` service.

       This option only applies when using the ``nova-network`` service. When using another networking services, such as Neutron, this should be to set to the ``nova.virt.firewall.NoopFirewallDriver``.

   * - ``flat_interface`` = ``None``
     - (String) This option is the name of the virtual interface of the VM on which the bridge will be built. While it was originally designed to be used only by nova-network, it is also used by libvirt for the bridge interface name.

   * - ``flat_network_bridge`` = ``None``

     - (Integer) This option represents the number of networks to create if not explicitly specified when the network is created. The only time this is used is if a CIDR is specified, but an explicit network_size is not. In that case, the subnets are created by diving the IP address space of the CIDR by num_networks. The resulting subnet sizes cannot be larger than the configuration option `network_size`; in that event, they are reduced to `network_size`, and a warning is logged.

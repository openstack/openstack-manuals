.. list-table:: Description of notifications configuration options
   :header-rows: 1
   :class: config-ref-table

   * - Configuration option = Default value
     - Description

   * - ``default_level`` = ``INFO``

     - (String) Default notification level for outgoing notifications.

   * - ``notification_format`` = ``both``

     - (String) Specifies which notification format shall be used by nova.

       The default value is fine for most deployments and rarely needs to be changed. This value can be set to 'versioned' once the infrastructure moves closer to consuming the newer format of notifications. After this occurs, this option will be removed (possibly in the "P" release).

       Possible values:

       * unversioned: Only the legacy unversioned notifications are emitted.

       * versioned: Only the new versioned notifications are emitted.

       * both: Both the legacy unversioned and the new versioned notifications are emitted. (Default)

       The list of versioned notifications is visible in http://docs.openstack.org/developer/nova/notifications.html

   * - ``notify_on_state_change`` = ``None``

     - (String) If set, send compute.instance.update notifications on instance state changes.

       Please refer to https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/SystemUsageData for additional information on notifications.

       Possible values:

       * None - no notifications

       * "vm_state" - notifications on VM state changes

       * "vm_and_task_state" - notifications on VM and task state changes

   * - ``notify_on_api_faults`` = ``False``

     - (Boolean) If enabled, send api.fault notifications on caught exceptions in the API service.

   * - ``default_publisher_id`` = ``$my_ip``

     - (String) Default publisher_id for outgoing notifications. If you consider routing notifications using different publisher, change this value accordingly.

       Possible values:

       * Defaults to the IPv4 address of this host, but it can be any valid oslo.messaging publisher_id

       Related options:

       * my_ip - IP address of this host

   * - ``versioned_notifications_topics`` = ``versioned_notifications``

     - (List) Specifies the topics for the versioned notifications issued by nova.

       The default value is fine for most deployments and rarely needs to be changed. However, if you have a third-party service that consumes versioned notifications, it might be worth getting a topic for that service. Nova will send a message containing a versioned notification payload to each topic queue in this list.

       The list of versioned notifications is visible in http://docs.openstack.org/developer/nova/notifications.html

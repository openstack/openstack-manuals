   :header-rows: 1
   :class: config-ref-table

   * - Configuration option = Default value
     - Description
   * - **[DEFAULT]**
     -
   * - ``cert`` = ``self.pem``
     - (String) Path to SSL certificate file.
   * - ``cert_manager`` = ``nova.cert.manager.CertManager``
     - (String) DEPRECATED: Full class name for the Manager for cert
   * - ``cert_topic`` = ``cert``
     - (String) DEPRECATED: Determines the RPC topic that the cert nodes listen on. For most deployments there is no need to ever change it. Since the nova-cert service is marked for deprecation, the feature to change RPC topic that cert nodes listen may be removed as early as the 15.0.0 Ocata release.

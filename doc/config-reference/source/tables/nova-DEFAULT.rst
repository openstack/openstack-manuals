.. list-table:: Description of DEFAULT configuration options
   :header-rows: 1
   :class: config-ref-table

   * - Configuration option = Default value
     - Description

   * - ``bandwidth_poll_interval`` = ``600``

     - (Integer) Interval to pull network bandwidth usage info.

       Not supported on all hypervisors. If a hypervisor doesn't support bandwidth usage, it will not get the info in the usage events.

       Possible values:

       * 0: Will run at the default periodic interval.

       * Any value < 0: Disables the option.

       * Any positive integer in seconds.

   * - ``default_floating_pool`` = ``nova``

     - (String) Default pool for floating IPs.

       This option specifies the default floating IP pool for allocating floating IPs.

       While allocating a floating ip, users can optionally pass in the name of the pool they want to allocate from, otherwise it will be pulled from the default pool.

       If this option is not set, then 'nova' is used as default floating pool.

       Possible values:

       * Any string representing a floating IP pool name

       - **Deprecated**

         This option was used for two purposes: to set the floating IP pool name for nova-network and to do the same for neutron. nova-network is deprecated, as are any related configuration options. Users of neutron, meanwhile, should use the 'default_floating_pool' option in the '[neutron]' group.

   * - ``translation_lazy_load`` = ``True``

     - (Boolean) Specifies whether to Lazy-Load Translation

   * - ``compute_topic`` = ``compute``

     - (String) This is the message queue topic that the compute service 'listens' on. It is used when the compute service is started up to configure the queue, and whenever an RPC call to the compute service is made.

       Possible values:

       * Any string, but there is almost never any reason to ever change this value from its default of 'compute'.

       - **Deprecated**

         There is no need to let users choose the RPC topic for all services - there is little gain from this. Furthermore, it makes it really easy to break Nova by using this option.

   * - ``remove_unused_base_images`` = ``True``

     - (Boolean) Should unused base images be removed?

   * - ``live_migration_retry_count`` = ``30``

     - (Integer) Maximum number of 1 second retries in live_migration. It specifies number of retries to iptables when it complains. It happens when an user continuously sends live-migration request to same host leading to concurrent request to iptables.

       Possible values:

       * Any positive integer representing retry count.

   * - ``flat_interface`` = ``None``

     - (String) This option is the name of the virtual interface of the VM on which the bridge will be built. While it was originally designed to be used only by nova-network, it is also used by libvirt for the bridge interface name.

       Possible values:

       * Any valid virtual interface name, such as 'eth0'

       - **Deprecated**

         nova-network is deprecated, as are any related configuration options.

   * - ``osapi_compute_listen_port`` = ``8774``

     - (Port number) Port on which the OpenStack API will listen.

       The OpenStack API service listens on this port number for incoming requests.

   * - ``ldap_dns_soa_expiry`` = ``86400``

     - (Integer) Expiry interval (in seconds) for LDAP DNS driver Start of Authority

       Time interval, a secondary/slave DNS server holds the information before it is no longer considered authoritative.

       - **Deprecated**

         nova-network is deprecated, as are any related configuration options.

   * - ``block_device_allocate_retries`` = ``60``

     - (Integer) Number of times to retry block device allocation on failures. Starting with Liberty, Cinder can use image volume cache. This may help with block device allocation performance. Look at the cinder image_volume_cache_enabled configuration option.

       Possible values:

       * 60 (default)

       * If value is 0, then one attempt is made.

       * Any negative value is treated as 0.

       * For any value > 0, total attempts are (value + 1)

   * - ``shutdown_timeout`` = ``60``

     - (Integer) Total time to wait in seconds for an instance toperform a clean shutdown.

       It determines the overall period (in seconds) a VM is allowed to perform a clean shutdown. While performing stop, rescue and shelve, rebuild operations, configuring this option gives the VM a chance to perform a controlled shutdown before the instance is powered off. The default timeout is 60 seconds.

       The timeout value can be overridden on a per image basis by means of os_shutdown_timeout that is an image metadata setting allowing different types of operating systems to specify how much time they need to shut down cleanly.

       Possible values:

       * Any positive integer in seconds (default value is 60).

   * - ``sync_power_state_pool_size`` = ``1000``

     - (Integer) Number of greenthreads available for use to sync power states.

       This option can be used to reduce the number of concurrent requests made to the hypervisor or system with real instance power states for performance reasons, for example, with Ironic.

       Possible values:

       * Any positive integer representing greenthreads count.

   * - ``teardown_unused_network_gateway`` = ``False``

       Please note that this option is only used when using nova-network instead of Neutron in your deployment.

       Possible values:

       * Any positive integer that is less than or equal to the available network size. Note that if you are creating multiple networks, they must all fit in the available IP address space. The default is 256.

       Related options:

       * ``use_neutron``

       * ``num_networks``

       - **Deprecated**

         nova-network is deprecated, as are any related configuration options.

     - (Multi-valued) Name of the mkfs commands for ephemeral device.

       The format is <os_type>=<mkfs command>

   * - ``enable_new_services`` = ``True``

     - (Boolean) Enable new services on this host automatically.

       When a new service (for example "nova-compute") starts up, it gets registered in the database as an enabled service. Sometimes it can be useful to register new services in disabled state and then enabled them at a later point in time. This option can set this behavior for all services per host.

       Possible values:

       * ``True``: Each new service is enabled as soon as it registers itself.

       * ``False``: Services must be enabled via a REST API call or with the CLI with ``nova service-enable <hostname> <binary>``, otherwise they are not ready to use.

   * - ``my_ip`` = ``10.0.0.1``

     - (String) The IP address which the host is using to connect to the management network.

   * - ``password_length`` = ``12``

     - (Integer) Length of generated instance admin passwords.

   * - ``reserved_huge_pages`` = ``None``

     - (Unknown) Number of huge/large memory pages to reserved per NUMA host cell.

       Possible values:

       * A list of valid key=value which reflect NUMA node ID, page size (Default unit is KiB) and number of pages to be reserved.

        reserved_huge_pages = node:0,size:2048,count:64 reserved_huge_pages = node:1,size:1GB,count:1

        In this example we are reserving on NUMA node 0 64 pages of 2MiB and on NUMA node 1 1 page of 1GiB.

   * - ``default_schedule_zone`` = ``None``

     - (String) Availability zone to use when user doesn't specify one.

       This option is used by the scheduler to determine which availability zone to place a new VM instance into if the user did not specify one at the time of VM boot request.

       Possible values:

       * Any string representing an availability zone name

       * Default value is None.

   * - ``use_neutron`` = ``True``

     - (Boolean) Enable neutron as the backend for networking.

       Determine whether to use Neutron or Nova Network as the back end. Set to true to use neutron.

       Related options:

       * enable_network_quota

       - **Deprecated**

         CRUD operations on tenant networks are only available when using nova-network and nova-network is itself deprecated.

   * - ``allow_resize_to_same_host`` = ``False``

     - (Boolean) Allow destination machine to match source for resize. Useful when testing in single-host environments. By default it is not allowed to resize to the same host. Setting this option to true will add the same host to the destination options. Also set to true if you allow the ServerGroupAffinityFilter and need to resize.

   * - ``reclaim_instance_interval`` = ``0``

     - (Integer) Interval for reclaiming deleted instances.

       A value greater than 0 will enable SOFT_DELETE of instances. This option decides whether the server to be deleted will be put into the SOFT_DELETED state. If this value is greater than 0, the deleted server will not be deleted immediately, instead it will be put into a queue until it's too old (deleted time greater than the value of reclaim_instance_interval). The server can be recovered from the delete queue by using the restore action. If the deleted server remains longer than the value of reclaim_instance_interval, it will be deleted by a periodic task in the compute service automatically.

       Note that this option is read from both the API and compute nodes, and must be set globally otherwise servers could be put into a soft deleted state in the API and never actually reclaimed (deleted) on the compute node.

       Possible values:

       * Any positive integer(in seconds) greater than 0 will enable this option.

       * Any value <=0 will disable the option.

   * - ``rootwrap_config`` = ``/etc/nova/rootwrap.conf``

     - (String) Path to the rootwrap configuration file.

       Goal of the root wrapper is to allow a service-specific unprivileged user to run a number of actions as the root user in the safest manner possible. The configuration file used here must match the one defined in the sudoers entry.

   * - ``reserved_host_cpus`` = ``0``

     - (Integer) Number of physical CPUs to reserve for the host. The host resources usage is reported back to the scheduler continuously from nova-compute running on the compute node. To prevent the host CPU from being considered as available, this option is used to reserve random pCPU(s) for the host.

       Possible values:

       * Any positive integer representing number of physical CPUs to reserve for the host.

   * - ``metadata_listen`` = ``0.0.0.0``

     - (String) IP address on which the metadata API will listen.

       The metadata API service listens on this IP address for incoming requests.

   * - ``syslog_log_facility`` = ``LOG_USER``

     - (String) Syslog facility to receive log lines. This option is ignored if log_config_append is set.

   * - ``force_config_drive`` = ``False``

     - (Boolean) Force injection to take place on a config drive

       When this option is set to true configuration drive functionality will be forced enabled by default, otherwise user can still enable configuration drives via the REST API or image metadata properties.

       Possible values:

       * True: Force to use of configuration drive regardless the user's input in the REST API call.

       * False: Do not force use of configuration drive. Config drives can still be enabled via the REST API or image metadata properties.

       Related options:

       * Use the 'mkisofs_cmd' flag to set the path where you install the genisoimage program. If genisoimage is in same path as the nova-compute service, you do not need to set this flag.

       * To use configuration drive with Hyper-V, you must set the 'mkisofs_cmd' value to the full path to an mkisofs.exe installation. Additionally, you must set the qemu_img_cmd value in the hyperv configuration section to the full path to an qemu-img command installation.

   * - ``fixed_range_v6`` = ``fd00::/48``

     - (String) This option determines the fixed IPv6 address block when creating a network.

       Please note that this option is only used when using nova-network instead of Neutron in your deployment.

     - (String) Full class name for the DNS Manager for floating IPs.

       This option specifies the class of the driver that provides functionality to manage DNS entries associated with floating IPs.

       When a user adds a DNS entry for a specified domain to a floating IP, nova will add a DNS entry using the specified floating DNS driver. When a floating IP is deallocated, its DNS entry will automatically be deleted.

       Possible values:

       * Full Python path to the class to be used

       Related options:

       * use_neutron: this options only works with nova-network.

         nova-network is deprecated, as are any related configuration options.

   * - ``state_path`` = ``$pybasedir``

     - (String) The top-level directory for maintaining Nova's state.

       This directory is used to store Nova's internal state. It is used by a variety of other config options which derive from this. In some scenarios (for example migrations) it makes sense to use a storage location which is shared between multiple compute hosts (for example via NFS). Unless the option ``instances_path`` gets overwritten, this directory can grow very large.

       Possible values:

       * The full path to a directory. Defaults to value provided in ``pybasedir``.

   * - ``injected_network_template`` = ``$pybasedir/nova/virt/interfaces.template``

     - (String) Path to '/etc/network/interfaces' template.

       The path to a template file for the '/etc/network/interfaces'-style file, which will be populated by nova and subsequently used by cloudinit. This provides a method to configure network connectivity in environments without a DHCP server.

       The template will be rendered using Jinja2 template engine, and receive a top-level key called ``interfaces``. This key will contain a list of dictionaries, one for each interface.

       Refer to the cloudinit documentaion for more information:

        https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/datasources.html

       Possible values:

       * A path to a Jinja2-formatted template for a Debian '/etc/network/interfaces' file. This applies even if using a non Debian-derived guest.

       * ``flat_inject``: This must be set to ``True`` to ensure nova embeds network configuration information in the metadata provided through the config drive.

   * - ``daemon`` = ``False``

     - (Boolean) Run as a background process.

   * - ``rate_limit_except_level`` = ``CRITICAL``

     - (String) Log level name used by rate limiting: CRITICAL, ERROR, INFO, WARNING, DEBUG or empty string. Logs with level greater or equal to rate_limit_except_level are not filtered. An empty string means that all levels are filtered.

   * - ``heal_instance_info_cache_interval`` = ``60``

     - (Integer) Interval between instance network information cache updates.

       Number of seconds after which each compute node runs the task of querying Neutron for all of its instances networking information, then updates the Nova db with that information. Nova will never update it's cache if this option is set to 0. If we don't update the cache, the metadata service and nova-api endpoints will be proxying incorrect network data about the instance. So, it is not recommended to set this option to 0.

       Possible values:

       * Any positive integer in seconds.

       * Any value <=0 will disable the sync. This is not recommended.

   * - ``resize_confirm_window`` = ``0``

     - (Integer) Automatically confirm resizes after N seconds.

       Resize functionality will save the existing server before resizing. After the resize completes, user is requested to confirm the resize. The user has the opportunity to either confirm or revert all changes. Confirm resize removes the original server and changes server status from resized to active. Setting this option to a time period (in seconds) will automatically confirm the resize if the server is in resized state longer than that time.

       Possible values:

       * 0: Disables the option (default)

       * Any positive integer in seconds: Enables the option.

   * - ``metadata_host`` = ``$my_ip``

     - (String) This option determines the IP address for the network metadata API server.

       This is really the client side of the metadata host equation that allows nova-network to find the metadata server when doing a default multi host networking.

       Possible values:

       * Any valid IP address. The default is the address of the Nova API server.

       Related options:

       * ``metadata_port``

   * - ``debug`` = ``False``

     - (Boolean) If set to true, the logging level will be set to DEBUG instead of the default INFO level.

       - **Mutable**

         This option can be changed without restarting.

   * - ``logging_user_identity_format`` = ``%(user)s %(tenant)s %(domain)s %(user_domain)s %(project_domain)s``

     - (String) Defines the format string for %(user_identity)s that is used in logging_context_format_string.

   * - ``routing_source_ip`` = ``$my_ip``

   * - ``firewall_driver`` = ``nova.virt.firewall.NoopFirewallDriver``

     - (String) Firewall driver to use with ``nova-network`` service.

       This option only applies when using the ``nova-network`` service. When using another networking services, such as Neutron, this should be to set to the ``nova.virt.firewall.NoopFirewallDriver``.

       Possible values:

       * ``nova.virt.firewall.IptablesFirewallDriver``

       * ``nova.virt.firewall.NoopFirewallDriver``

       * ``nova.virt.libvirt.firewall.IptablesFirewallDriver``

     - (String) Configuration drive format

       Configuration drive format that will contain metadata attached to the instance when it boots.

       Possible values:

       * iso9660: A file system image standard that is widely supported across operating systems. NOTE: Mind the libvirt bug (https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1246201) - If your hypervisor driver is libvirt, and you want live migrate to work without shared storage, then use VFAT.

       * vfat: For legacy reasons, you can configure the configuration drive to use VFAT format instead of ISO 9660.

       Related options:

       * This option is meaningful when one of the following alternatives occur: 1. force_config_drive option set to 'true' 2. the REST API call to create the instance contains an enable flag for config drive option 3. the image used to create the instance requires a config drive, this is defined by img_config_drive property for that image.

       * A compute node running Hyper-V hypervisor can be configured to attach configuration drive as a CD drive. To attach the configuration drive as a CD drive, set config_drive_cdrom option at hyperv section, to true.

   * - ``block_device_allocate_retries_interval`` = ``3``

     - (Integer) Interval (in seconds) between block device allocation retries on failures.

       This option allows the user to specify the time interval between consecutive retries. 'block_device_allocate_retries' option specifies the maximum number of retries.

       Possible values:

       * 0: Disables the option.

       * Any positive integer in seconds enables the option.

       Related options:

       * ``block_device_allocate_retries`` in compute_manager_opts group.

   * - ``shelved_offload_time`` = ``0``

     - (Integer) Time before a shelved instance is eligible for removal from a host.

       By default this option is set to 0 and the shelved instance will be removed from the hypervisor immediately after shelve operation. Otherwise, the instance will be kept for the value of shelved_offload_time(in seconds) so that during the time period the unshelve action will be faster, then the periodic task will remove the instance from hypervisor after shelved_offload_time passes.

       Possible values:

       * 0: Instance will be immediately offloaded after being shelved.

       * Any value < 0: An instance will never offload.

       * Any positive integer in seconds: The instance will exist for the specified number of seconds before being offloaded.

   * - ``instance_dns_manager`` = ``nova.network.noop_dns_driver.NoopDNSDriver``

     - (String) Full class name for the DNS Manager for instance IPs.

       This option specifies the class of the driver that provides functionality to manage DNS entries for instances.

       On instance creation, nova will add DNS entries for the instance name and id, using the specified instance DNS driver and domain. On instance deletion, nova will remove the DNS entries.

       Possible values:

       * Full Python path to the class to be used

       Related options:

       * use_neutron: this options only works with nova-network.

       - **Deprecated**

   * - ``pointer_model`` = ``usbtablet``

     - (String) Generic property to specify the pointer type.

       Input devices allow interaction with a graphical framebuffer. For example to provide a graphic tablet for absolute cursor movement.

       If set, the 'hw_pointer_model' image property takes precedence over this configuration option.

       Possible values:

       * None: Uses default behavior provided by drivers (mouse on PS2 for libvirt x86)

       * ps2mouse: Uses relative movement. Mouse connected by PS2

       * usbtablet: Uses absolute movement. Tablet connect by USB

       Related options:

   * - ``ebtables_retry_interval`` = ``1.0``

     - (Floating point) This option determines the time, in seconds, that the system will sleep in between ebtables retries. Note that each successive retry waits a multiple of this value, so for example, if this is set to the default of 1.0 seconds, and ebtables_exec_attempts is 4, after the first failure, the system will sleep for 1 * 1.0 seconds, after the second failure it will sleep 2 * 1.0 seconds, and after the third failure it will sleep 3 * 1.0 seconds.

       Possible values:

       * Any non-negative float or integer. Setting this to zero will result in no waiting between attempts.

   * - ``disk_allocation_ratio`` = ``0.0``

     - (Floating point) This option helps you specify virtual disk to physical disk allocation ratio.

       From Ocata (15.0.0) this is used to influence the hosts selected by the Placement API. Note that when Placement is used, the DiskFilter is redundant, because the Placement API will have already filtered out hosts that would have failed the DiskFilter.

       A ratio greater than 1.0 will result in over-subscription of the available physical disk, which can be useful for more efficiently packing instances created with images that do not use the entire virtual disk, such as sparse or compressed images. It can be set to a value between 0.0 and 1.0 in order to preserve a percentage of the disk for uses other than instances.

       NOTE: This can be set per-compute, or if set to 0.0, the value set on the scheduler node(s) or compute node(s) will be used and defaulted to 1.0.

       NOTE: As of the 16.0.0 Pike release, this configuration option is ignored for the ironic.IronicDriver compute driver and is hardcoded to 1.0.

       If set to true, this option allows services to periodically run tasks on the manager.

       In case of running multiple schedulers or conductors you may want to run periodic tasks on only one host - in this case disable this option for all hosts but one.

   * - ``iptables_drop_action`` = ``DROP``

     - (String) By default, packets that do not pass the firewall are DROPped. In many cases, though, an operator may find it more useful to change this from DROP to REJECT, so that the user issuing those packets may have a better idea as to what's going on, or LOGDROP in order to record the blocked traffic before DROPping.

   * - ``instance_name_template`` = ``instance-%08x``

     - (String) Template string to be used to generate instance names.

       This template controls the creation of the database name of an instance. This is *not* the display name you enter when creating an instance (via Horizon or CLI). For a new deployment it is advisable to change the default value (which uses the database autoincrement) to another value which makes use of the attributes of an instance, like ``instance-%(uuid)s``. If you already have instances in your deployment when you change this, your deployment will break.

       Possible values:

   * - ``preallocate_images`` = ``none``

     - (String) The image preallocation mode to use.

       Image preallocation allows storage for instance images to be allocated up front when the instance is initially provisioned. This ensures immediate feedback is given if enough space isn't available. In addition, it should significantly improve performance on writes to new blocks and may even improve I/O performance to prewritten blocks due to reduced fragmentation.

       Possible values:

       * "none" => no storage provisioning is done up front

       * "space" => storage is fully allocated at instance start

   * - ``reboot_timeout`` = ``0``

     - (Integer) Time interval after which an instance is hard rebooted automatically.

       When doing a soft reboot, it is possible that a guest kernel is completely hung in a way that causes the soft reboot task to not ever finish. Setting this option to a time period in seconds will automatically hard reboot an instance if it has been stuck in a rebooting state longer than N seconds.

       Possible values:

       * 0: Disables the option (default).

       * Any positive integer in seconds: Enables the option.

   * - ``multi_host`` = ``False``

     - (Boolean) Default value for multi_host in networks.

       nova-network service can operate in a multi-host or single-host mode. In multi-host mode each compute node runs a copy of nova-network and the instances on that compute node use the compute node as a gateway to the Internet. Where as in single-host mode, a central server runs the nova-network service. All compute nodes forward traffic from the instances to the cloud controller which then forwards traffic to the Internet.

       If this options is set to true, some rpc network calls will be sent directly to host.

       * Integer greater than 0

   * - ``servicegroup_driver`` = ``db``

     - (String) This option specifies the driver to be used for the servicegroup service.

       ServiceGroup API in nova enables checking status of a compute node. When a compute worker running the nova-compute daemon starts, it calls the join API to join the compute group. Services like nova scheduler can query the ServiceGroup API to check if a node is alive. Internally, the ServiceGroup client driver automatically updates the compute worker status. There are multiple backend implementations for this service: Database ServiceGroup driver and Memcache ServiceGroup driver.

   * - ``ssl_only`` = ``False``

     - (Boolean) Disallow non-encrypted connections.

   * - ``ram_allocation_ratio`` = ``0.0``

     - (Floating point) This option helps you specify virtual RAM to physical RAM allocation ratio.

       From Ocata (15.0.0) this is used to influence the hosts selected by the Placement API. Note that when Placement is used, the RamFilter is redundant, because the Placement API will have already filtered out hosts that would have failed the RamFilter.

       This configuration specifies ratio for RamFilter which can be set per compute node. For AggregateRamFilter, it will fall back to this configuration value if no per-aggregate setting found.

       NOTE: This can be set per-compute, or if set to 0.0, the value set on the scheduler node(s) or compute node(s) will be used and defaulted to 1.5.

       NOTE: As of the 16.0.0 Pike release, this configuration option is ignored for the ironic.IronicDriver compute driver and is hardcoded to 1.0.

       Possible values:

       * Any valid positive integer or float value

   * - ``resize_fs_using_block_device`` = ``False``

     - (Boolean) Enable resizing of filesystems via a block device.

       If enabled, attempt to resize the filesystem by accessing the image over a block device. This is done by the host and may not be necessary if the image contains a recent version of cloud-init. Possible mechanisms require the nbd driver (for qcow and raw), or loop (for raw).

   * - ``key`` = ``None``

     - (String) SSL key file (if separate from cert).

   * - ``vlan_interface`` = ``None``

     - (String) This option is the name of the virtual interface of the VM on which the VLAN bridge will be built. While it was originally designed to be used only by nova-network, it is also used by libvirt and xenapi for the bridge interface name.

       Please note that this setting will be ignored in nova-network if the configuration option for `network_manager` is not set to the default of 'nova.network.manager.VlanManager'.

       Possible values:

       * Any valid virtual interface name, such as 'eth0'

       - **Deprecated**

         nova-network is deprecated, as are any related configuration options. While this option has an effect when using neutron, it incorrectly override the value provided by neutron and should therefore not be used.

     - (String) Scheduler message queue topic.

       This is the message queue topic that the scheduler 'listens' on. It is used when the scheduler service is started up to configure the queue, and whenever an RPC call to the scheduler is made. There is almost never any reason to ever change this value.

       Possible values:

       * A valid AMQP topic name

       - **Deprecated**

         There is no need to let users choose the RPC topic for all services - there is little gain from this. Furthermore, it makes it really easy to break Nova by using this option.

   * - ``send_arp_for_ha`` = ``False``

     - (Boolean) When True, when a device starts up, and upon binding floating IP addresses, arp messages will be sent to ensure that the arp caches on the compute hosts are up-to-date.

       Related options:

       * ``send_arp_for_ha_count``

       When compute workers are restarted in unison across a cluster, they all end up running the periodic tasks at the same time causing problems for the external services. To mitigate this behavior, periodic_fuzzy_delay option allows you to introduce a random initial delay when starting the periodic task scheduler.

       Possible Values:

       * Any positive integer (in seconds)

       * 0 : disable the random delay

   * - ``metadata_workers`` = ``None``

     - (Integer) Number of workers for metadata service. If not specified the number of available CPUs will be used.

   * - ``null_kernel`` = ``nokernel``

     - (String) This option is used to decide when an image should have no external ramdisk or kernel. By default this is set to 'nokernel', so when an image is booted with the property 'kernel_id' with the value 'nokernel', Nova assumes the image doesn't require an external kernel and ramdisk.

       - **Deprecated**

         When an image is booted with the property 'kernel_id' with the value 'nokernel', Nova assumes the image doesn't require an external kernel and ramdisk. This option allows user to change the API behaviour which should not be allowed and this value "nokernel" should be hard coded.

   * - ``mkisofs_cmd`` = ``genisoimage``

     - (String) Name or path of the tool used for ISO image creation

       Use the mkisofs_cmd flag to set the path where you install the genisoimage program. If genisoimage is on the system path, you do not need to change the default value.

       To use configuration drive with Hyper-V, you must set the mkisofs_cmd value to the full path to an mkisofs.exe installation. Additionally, you must set the qemu_img_cmd value in the hyperv configuration section to the full path to an qemu-img command installation.

       Possible values:

       * Name of the ISO image creator program, in case it is in the same directory as the nova-compute service

       * Path to ISO image creator program

       Related options:

       * report_interval (service_down_time should not be less than report_interval)

   * - ``defer_iptables_apply`` = ``False``

     - (Boolean) Whether to batch up the application of IPTables rules during a host restart and apply all at the end of the init phase.

   * - ``publish_errors`` = ``False``

   * - ``consoleauth_topic`` = ``consoleauth``

     - (String) This option allows you to change the message topic used by nova-consoleauth service when communicating via the AMQP server. Nova Console Authentication server authenticates nova consoles. Users can then access their instances through VNC clients. The Nova API service uses a message queue to communicate with nova-consoleauth to get a VNC console.

       Possible Values:

       * 'consoleauth' (default) or Any string representing topic exchange name.

       - **Deprecated**

         There is no need to let users choose the RPC topic for all services - there is little gain from this. Furthermore, it makes it really easy to break Nova by using this option.

   * - ``update_resources_interval`` = ``0``

     - (Integer) Interval for updating compute resources.

       This option specifies how often the update_available_resources periodic task should run. A number less than 0 means to disable the task completely. Leaving this at the default of 0 will cause this to run at the default periodic interval. Setting it to any positive value will cause it to run at approximately that number of seconds.

       Possible values:

       * 0: Will run at the default periodic interval.

       * Any value < 0: Disables the option.

   * - ``vif_plugging_is_fatal`` = ``True``

     - (Boolean) Determine if instance should boot or fail on VIF plugging timeout.

       Nova sends a port update to Neutron after an instance has been scheduled, providing Neutron with the necessary information to finish setup of the port. Once completed, Neutron notifies Nova that it has finished setting up the port, at which point Nova resumes the boot of the instance since network connectivity is now supposed to be present. A timeout will occur if the reply is not received after a given interval.

       This option determines what Nova does when the VIF plugging timeout event happens. When enabled, the instance will error out. When disabled, the instance will continue to boot on the assumption that the port is ready.

       Possible values:

       * True: Instances should fail after VIF plugging timeout

       * False: Instances should continue booting after VIF plugging timeout

   * - ``maximum_instance_delete_attempts`` = ``5``

     - (Integer) The number of times to attempt to reap an instance's files.

       This option specifies the maximum number of retry attempts that can be made.

       Possible values:

       * Any positive integer defines how many attempts are made.

       * Any value <=0 means no delete attempts occur, but you should use ``instance_delete_interval`` to disable the delete attempts.

       Possible values:

       * A string representing fully classified class name of console driver.

       - **Deprecated**

         This option no longer does anything. Previously this option had only two valid, in-tree values: nova.console.xvp.XVPConsoleProxy and nova.console.fake.FakeConsoleProxy. The latter of these was only used in tests and has since been replaced.

   * - ``dns_server`` = ``[]``

     - (Multi-valued) Despite the singular form of the name of this option, it is actually a list of zero or more server addresses that dnsmasq will use for DNS nameservers. If this is not empty, dnsmasq will not read /etc/resolv.conf, but will only use the servers specified in this option. If the option use_network_dns_servers is True, the dns1 and dns2 servers from the network will be appended to this list, and will be used as DNS servers, too.

       Possible values:

       * A list of strings, where each string is either an IP address or a FQDN.

   * - ``allow_same_net_traffic`` = ``True``

     - (Boolean) Determine whether to allow network traffic from same network.

       When set to true, hosts on the same subnet are not filtered and are allowed to pass all types of traffic between them. On a flat network, this allows all instances from all projects unfiltered communication. With VLAN networking, this allows access between instances within the same project.

       This option only applies when using the ``nova-network`` service. When using another networking services, such as Neutron, security groups or other approaches should be used.

       Possible values:

       * True: Network traffic should be allowed pass between all instances on the same network, regardless of their tenant and security policies

       * False: Network traffic should not be allowed pass between instances unless it is unblocked in a security group

       Related options:

   * - ``share_dhcp_address`` = ``False``

     - (Boolean) THIS VALUE SHOULD BE SET WHEN CREATING THE NETWORK.

       If True in multi_host mode, all compute hosts share the same dhcp address. The same IP address used for DHCP will be added on each nova-network node which is only visible to the VMs on the same host.

       The use of this configuration has been deprecated and may be removed in any release after Mitaka. It is recommended that instead of relying on this option, an explicit value should be passed to 'create_networks()' as a keyword argument with the name 'share_address'.

   * - ``max_local_block_devices`` = ``3``

     - (Integer) Maximum number of devices that will result in a local image being created on the hypervisor node.

       A negative number means unlimited. Setting max_local_block_devices to 0 means that any request that attempts to create a local disk will fail. This option is meant to limit the number of local discs (so root local disc that is the result of --image being used, and any other ephemeral and swap disks). 0 does not mean that images will be automatically converted to volumes and boot instances from volumes - it just means that all requests that attempt to create a local disk will fail.

       Possible values:

     - (Integer) Limits the maximum number of instance builds to run concurrently by nova-compute. Compute service can attempt to build an infinite number of instances, if asked to do so. This limit is enforced to avoid building unlimited instance concurrently on a compute node. This value can be set per compute node.

         nova-network is deprecated, as are any related configuration options.

   * - ``bindir`` = ``/usr/local/bin``

     - (String) The directory where the Nova binaries are installed.

       This option is only relevant if the networking capabilities from Nova are used (see services below). Nova's networking capabilities are targeted to be fully replaced by Neutron in the future. It is very unlikely that you need to change this option from its default value.

       Possible values:

       * The full path to a directory.

   * - ``default_flavor`` = ``m1.small``

     - (String) Default flavor to use for the EC2 API only. The Nova API does not support a default flavor.

        vcpu_pin_set = "4-12,^8,15"

   * - ``cpu_allocation_ratio`` = ``0.0``

     - (Floating point) This option helps you specify virtual CPU to physical CPU allocation ratio.

       From Ocata (15.0.0) this is used to influence the hosts selected by the Placement API. Note that when Placement is used, the CoreFilter is redundant, because the Placement API will have already filtered out hosts that would have failed the CoreFilter.

       This configuration specifies ratio for CoreFilter which can be set per compute node. For AggregateCoreFilter, it will fall back to this configuration value if no per-aggregate setting is found.

       NOTE: This can be set per-compute, or if set to 0.0, the value set on the scheduler node(s) or compute node(s) will be used and defaulted to 16.0.

       NOTE: As of the 16.0.0 Pike release, this configuration option is ignored for the ironic.IronicDriver compute driver and is hardcoded to 1.0.

       Possible values:

       * Any valid positive integer or float value

   * - ``instance_uuid_format`` = ``"[instance: %(uuid)s] "``

   * - ``scheduler_instance_sync_interval`` = ``120``

     - (Integer) Interval between sending the scheduler a list of current instance UUIDs to verify that its view of instances is in sync with nova.

       If the CONF option 'scheduler_tracks_instance_changes' is False, the sync calls will not be made. So, changing this option will have no effect.

       If the out of sync situations are not very common, this interval can be increased to lower the number of RPC messages being sent. Likewise, if sync issues turn out to be a problem, the interval can be lowered to check more frequently.

       Possible values:

       * 0: Will run at the default periodic interval.

       * Any value < 0: Disables the option.

       * Any positive integer in seconds.

   * - ``osapi_compute_unique_server_name_scope`` =

     - (String) Sets the scope of the check for unique instance names.

       The default doesn't check for unique names. If a scope for the name check is set, a launch of a new instance or an update of an existing instance with a duplicate name will result in an ''InstanceExists'' error. The uniqueness is case-insensitive. Setting this option can increase the usability for end users as they don't have to distinguish among instances with the same name by their IDs.

       Possible values:

       * '': An empty value means that no uniqueness check is done and duplicate names are possible.

       * "project": The instance name check is done only for instances within the same project.

       * "global": The instance name check is done for all instances regardless of the project.

       Possible values:

       * 0: Will run at the default periodic interval.

       * Any value < 0: Disables the option.

     - (Floating point) Float representation of the over subscription ratio when thin provisioning is involved. Default ratio is 20.0, meaning provisioned capacity can be 20 times the total physical capacity. If the ratio is 10.5, it means provisioned capacity can be 10.5 times the total physical capacity. A ratio of 1.0 means provisioned capacity cannot exceed the total physical capacity. A ratio lower than 1.0 is invalid.

     - (Integer) Number of times to attempt to run flakey shell commands.
   * - ``periodic_fuzzy_delay`` = ``60``
     - (Integer) Range of seconds to randomly delay when starting the periodic task scheduler to reduce stampeding. (Disable by setting to 0)
   * - ``periodic_hooks_interval`` = ``300.0``

   * - ``replication_domain`` = ``None``
     - (String) A string specifying the replication domain that the backend belongs to. This option needs to be specified the same in the configuration sections of all backends that support replication between each other. If this option is not specified in the group, it means that replication is not enabled on the backend.
   * - ``report_interval`` = ``10``
     - (Integer) Seconds between nodes reporting state to datastore.
   * - ``reserved_share_percentage`` = ``0``

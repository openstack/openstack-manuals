================================
Generate Configuration Reference
================================

The OpenStack Configuration Reference source files are stored
in the ``openstack-manuals`` repository. The majority of files are
automatically generated and should not be modified manually. To update
automatically generated files, use the ``autohelp-wrapper`` tool found in the
`openstack-doc-tools <https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/openstack-doc-tools>`_
repository.

To distinguish an automatically generated file from the file that can be
edited manually, verify it contains the warning at the top of the file:

.. code-block:: none

   ## WARNING ######################################
   This file is automatically generated, do not edit
   #################################################

autogenerate_config_docs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Automatically generate configuration tables to document OpenStack.

Requirements
------------

Prior to running the generation script, you need to install several
development packages.

On Ubuntu:

.. code-block:: console

   $ sudo apt-get install python-dev python-pip python-virtualenv \
                           libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev zlib1g-dev \
                           libmysqlclient-dev libpq-dev libffi-dev \
                           libsqlite3-dev libldap2-dev libsasl2-dev \
                           libjpeg-dev liberasurecode-dev

On RHEL 7 and CentOS 7:

.. code-block:: console

   $ sudo yum install https://www.rdoproject.org/repos/rdo-release.rpm
   $ sudo yum update
   $ sudo yum install python-devel python-pip python-virtualenv \
                           libxml2-devel libxslt-devel zlib-devel \
                           mariadb-devel postgresql-devel libffi-devel \
                           sqlite-devel openldap-devel cyrus-sasl-devel \
                           libjpeg-turbo-devel liberasurecode-devel gcc git

.. note::

   * libjpeg is needed for ironic
   * liberasurecode is needed for swift

Using the wrapper
-----------------

Use the ``autohelp-wrapper`` script to generate the configuration tables.

.. important::

   Do not use ``autohelp.py`` manually.

The ``autohelp-wrapper`` script installs a virtual environment and all the
needed dependencies, clones or updates the projects and manuals repositories,
then runs the ``autohelp.py`` script in the virtual environment.

New and updated flagmappings are generated in the ``openstack-manuals``
repository (``tools/autogenerate-config-flagmappings/`` directory).

The workflow is:

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
   $ ./autohelp-wrapper update
   $ $EDITOR sources/openstack-manuals/tools/autogenerate-config-flagmappings/*.flagmappings
   $ ./autohelp-wrapper rst

Check the results in sources/openstack-manuals after completing the workflow.
This process generates the tables for all the known projects.


.. important::

   For the Networking service (neutron) project, if the driver/plugin resides
   outside the neutron repository, then the driver/plugin has to be explicitly
   installed within the virtual environment to generate the configuration
   options.

To generate the mappings and tables for a subset of projects, use the code
names as arguments:

.. code-block:: console

   $ ./autohelp-wrapper update cinder heat

   // edit the mappings files

   $ ./autohelp-wrapper rst cinder heat

Flagmappings files
------------------

The tool uses flagmapping files to map options to custom categories. Flag
mapping files are in the ``tools/autogenerate-config-flagmappings`` folder of
the openstack-manuals project. Not all projects use flagmapping files. These
projects disabled by a ``$project.disable`` file in that folder. Flag mapping
files use the following format:

.. code-block:: ini

   OPTION_SECTION/OPTION_NAME group1 [group2, ...]

Groups need to be defined manually to organize the configuration tables.

The group values can only contain alphanumeric characters, ``_`` and ``-``
(they will be used as document IDs).

To make the table titles more user friendly, create or edit the
``PROJECT.headers`` file in the manuals repository. Each line of this file
is of the form:

.. code-block:: none

   GROUP A Nice Title

Working with branches
---------------------

``autohelp-wrapper`` works on the master branch by default, but you can tell it
to work on another branch:

.. code-block:: console

   $ ./autohelp-wrapper -b stable/liberty update

.. note::

   The ``-b`` switch does not apply to the ``openstack-manuals`` repository
   which will be left untouched (no ``git branch``, no ``git update``).


Updating swift options
----------------------

Swift configuration tables are generated using the ``extract_swift_flags.py``
script. This script does not use a mapping file, but organizes the tables using
the various configuration files and sections. Most of the options must be
described manually at the moment.

Generating configuration difference
-----------------------------------

To generate "New, updated, and deprecated options" for each service,
run ``diff_branches.py``. For example:

.. code-block:: console

   $ ./diff_branches.py stable/liberty stable/mitaka nova

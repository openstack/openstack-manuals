    <title>Case studies: system documentation</title>
    <para>In this case study we discuss how Alice and Bob would address their system documentation requirements. The documentation suggested above includes hardware and software records, network diagrams, and system configuration details.</para>

      <title>Alice's private cloud</title>
      <para>Alice needs detailed documentation to satisfy FedRamp requirements. She sets up a configuration management database (CMDB) to store information regarding all of the hardware, firmware, and software versions used throughout the cloud. She also creates a network diagram detailing the cloud architecture, paying careful attention to the security domains and the services that span multiple security domains.</para>
      <para>Alice also needs to record each network service running in the cloud, what interfaces and ports it binds to, the security domains for each service, and why the service is needed. Alice decides to build automated tools to log into each system in the cloud over secure shell (SSH) using the <link xlink:href="http://fabfile.org">Python Fabric library</link>. The tools collect and store the information in the CMDB, which simplifies the audit process.</para>

May 20, 2014

To do tasks:
- Add OpenStack Security Notes (OSSN) as appendix
- Update for icehouse - this guide is continually released, but hasn't
had updates for latest releases of OpenStack
- Document SSL everywhere (it's there but does it need updating for latest
releases?)
- Document Hyper-V considerations and Windows security
- Document key management - Barbican is not yet integrated so must link
to their documentation externally and document Kite and other solutions
- Standardize diagrams
- Add audience information; who is this book intended for

Ongoing tasks:
- Ensure it meets conventions and standards
- Triage incoming bugs in openstack-manuals project
- Continually update with latest release information relevant to security

Wishlist tasks:
- Replace all individual client commands (like keystone, nova) with openstack client commands

When configuring the trusted certificate authority (CA) bundle that your messaging server uses to verify client connections, it is recommended that this be limited to only the CA used for your nodes, preferably an internally managed CA. The bundle of trusted CAs will determine which client certificates will be authorized and pass the client-server verification step of the setting up the SSL connection.

msgid "The built-in or included web server that comes with OpenStack Object Storage supports SSL, but it does not support transmission of the entire SSL certificate chain. This causes issues when you use a third party trusted and signed certificate, such as Verisign, for your cloud. The current work around is to not use the built-in web server but an alternative web server instead that supports sending both the public server certificate as well as the CA signing authorities intermediate certificate(s). This allows for end-point clients that have the CA root certificate in their trust store to be able to successfully validate your cloud environment's SSL certificate and chain. An example of how to do this with mod_wsgi and Apache is given below.

The use of a port greater than 1024 is required to make this easy and avoid running any part of the web container as root. Doing so is not a burden as end-point clients are not typically going to type in the URL manually into a web browser to browse around in the object storage. Additionally, for clients using the HTTP REST API and performing authentication they will normally automatically grab the full REST API URL they are to use as provided by the authentication response. OpenStack’s REST API allows for a client to authenticate to one URL and then be told to use a completely different URL for the actual service. Example: Client authenticates to <uri>https://identity.cloud.example.org:55443/v1/auth</uri> and gets a response with their authentication key and Storage URL (the URL of the proxy nodes or load balancer) of <uri>https://swift.cloud.example.org:44443/v1/AUTH_8980</uri>."

    <title>Securing OpenStack Networking services</title>
    <para>
      To secure OpenStack Networking, you must understand how the
      workflow process for tenant instance creation needs to be mapped
      to security domains.</para>
    <para>
      There are four main services that interact with OpenStack
      Networking. In a typical OpenStack deployment these services map
      to the following security domains:</para>

    <para>To isolate sensitive data communication between the
        OpenStack Networking services and other OpenStack core
        services, configure these communication channels to only allow
        communication over an isolated management network.</para>

        <para>
          To restrict the interface or IP address on which the
          OpenStack Networking API service binds a network socket for
          incoming client connections, specify the bind_host and
          bind_port in the neutron.conf file as shown:</para>
        <programlisting language="ini">
# Address to bind the API server
bind_host = <replaceable>IP ADDRESS OF SERVER</replaceable>

# Port the bind the API server to
bind_port = 9696</programlisting>

        <para>
          Various components of the OpenStack Networking services use
          either the messaging queue or database connections to
          communicate with other components in OpenStack
          Networking.</para>

          It is recommended that you follow the guidelines provided in

          the Database section for all components that require direct
          DB connections.</para>

OpenStack dashboard
===================

As a cloud administrative user, the OpenStack dashboard lets you
create and manage projects, users, images, and flavors. You can also
set quotas, and create and manage services. For information about using
the dashboard to perform end user tasks, see the `OpenStack End User
Guide <http://docs.openstack.org/user-guide/>`__.

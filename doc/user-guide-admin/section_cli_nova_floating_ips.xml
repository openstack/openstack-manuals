    <title>Manage IP addresses</title>
    <para>Each instance can have a private, or <emphasis role="italic"
            >fixed</emphasis>, IP address and an IP address, often
        public, that is movable from instance to instance called a
            <emphasis role="italic">floating</emphasis> IP
        address.</para>
    <para>Private IP addresses are used for communication between
        instances and public ones are used for communication with the
        outside world.</para>
    <para>When you launch an instance, it is automatically assigned a
        private IP address that stays the same until you explicitly
        terminate the instance. Rebooting an instance has no effect on
        its private IP address.</para>
    <para>The cloud operator must configure a pool of floating IP
        addresses. Then, you can allocate a certain number of floating
        IP addresses from this pool to a project. A project quota
        defines the maximum number of floating IP addresses for the
        project.</para>
    <para>You can add a floating IP address from this pool to an
        instance in the project. You can dynamically associate
        floating IP addresses with or disassociate floating IP
        addresses from instances in the same project at any
        time.</para>
    <para>Before you can assign a floating IP address to an instance,
        you must allocate floating IP addresses to a project. After
        you allocate floating IP addresses to the current project, you
        can assign them to running instances.</para>
    <para>You can assign one floating IP address to only one instance
        at a time. Use the <command>nova *floating-ip-*</command>
        commands to manage floating IP addresses.</para>

            <para>To assign a fixed IP address to a floating IP

            <para>After you assign the floating IP address and
                configure security group rules for the instance, the
                instance is publicly available at the floating IP
                address.</para>

            <para>The floating IP address is returned to the floating
                IP address pool that is available to all projects. If
                a floating IP address is assigned to a running
                instance, it is automatically disassociated from that
                instance.</para>

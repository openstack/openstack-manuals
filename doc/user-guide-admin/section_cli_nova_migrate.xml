    <title>Migrate single instance to another compute host</title>
    <para>When you want to move an instance from one compute host to another,
        you can use the <command>nova migrate</command> command. The scheduler
        chooses the destination compute host based on its settings. This process
        does not assume that the instance has shared storage available on the
        target host.</para>

        <step>
            <para>To list the VMs you want to migrate, run:</para>

    <title>Migrate all instances to another compute host</title>
    <para>When you want to move all instances from one compute host to
        another, you can use the <command>nova
            host-servers-migrate</command> command. The difference
        between this command and the <command>nova evacuate</command>
        command is that you can specify the host when evacuating. Also
        when evacuating, you must configure shared storage on the
        target host so that user data is preserved on the server disk.
        See <link xlink:href="http://docs.openstack.org/user-guide/content/nova_cli_evacuate.html">Evacuate instances</link>.</para>

        <step>
            <para>To list the host you want to migrate, run:</para>

        </step>
        <step>
            <para>After selecting a host from the list, run this
                command:

            <para>All instances are booted from a new host while preserving
                their current configurations, including ID, name, UUID, IP
                address, and so on.</para>

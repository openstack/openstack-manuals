    <title>Configure access and security for instances</title>
    <?dbhtml stop-chunking?>
    <para>Before you launch an instance, you should add security group rules to
        enable users to ping and use SSH to connect to the instance. Security
        groups are sets of IP filter rules that define networking access and are
        applied to all instances within a project. To do so, you either <link
            xlink:href="#security_groups_add_rule">add rules to the default
            security group</link> or add a new security group with rules.</para>
    <para>Key pairs are SSH credentials that are injected into an
        instance when it is launched. To use key pair injection, the
        image that the instance is based on must contain the
            <literal>cloud-init</literal> package. Each project should
        have at least one key pair. For more information, see <xref
            linkend="keypair_add"/>.</para>
    <para>If you have generated a key pair with an external tool, you
        can import it into OpenStack. The key pair can be used for
        multiple instances that belong to a project. For more
        information, see <xref linkend="dashboard_import_keypair"
        />.</para>
    <para>When an instance is created in OpenStack, it is automatically
        assigned a fixed IP address in the network to which the
        instance is assigned. This IP address is permanently
        associated with the instance until the instance is terminated.
        However, in addition to the fixed IP address, a floating IP
        address can also be attached to an instance. Unlike fixed IP
        addresses, floating IP addresses are able to have their
        associations modified at any time, regardless of the state of
        the instances involved.</para>

        <title>Add a rule to the default security group</title>
        <para>This procedure enables SSH and ICMP (ping) access to

            project, and should be set for every project unless there
            is a reason to prohibit SSH or ICMP access to the
            instances.</para>
        <para>This procedure can be adjusted as necessary to add
            additional security group rules to a project, if your

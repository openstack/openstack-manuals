        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>Identity Service user with sudo privileges. Because
                Apache does not serve content from a root user, users

                with sudo privileges.</para>
        </listitem>

            <para>Python 2.6 or 2.7. The Python version must support
                Django. The Python version should run on any

                might differ by platform.</para>
        </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>Then, install and configure the dashboard on a node that
        can contact the Identity Service.</para>
    <para>Provide users with the following information so that they
        can access the dashboard through a web browser on their local

                access the dashboard</para>

    </itemizedlist>
    <para>Your web browser, and that of your users,
         must support HTML5 and have cookies and
        JavaScript enabled.</para>
    <note>
        <para>To use the VNC client with the dashboard, the browser
            must support HTML5 Canvas and HTML5 WebSockets.</para>

  <title>Add the Block Storage service</title>
  <para>The OpenStack Block Storage service provides block storage devices
    to guest instances. The method in which the storage is provisioned and
    consumed is determined by the Block Storage driver, or drivers
    in the case of a multi-backend configuration. There are a variety of
    drivers that are available: NAS/SAN, NFS, iSCSI, Ceph, and more.
    The Block Storage API and scheduler services typically run on the controller
    nodes. Depending upon the drivers used, the volume service can run
    on controllers, compute nodes, or standalone storage nodes.

  <note>
    <para>This chapter omits the backup manager because it depends on the
      Object Storage service.</para>

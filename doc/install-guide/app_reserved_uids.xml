  <title>Reserved user IDs</title>

  <para>
    In OpenStack, certain user IDs are reserved and used to run
    specific OpenStack services and own specific OpenStack
    files. These users are set up according to the distribution
    packages. The following table gives an overview.
  </para>

  <note os="debian;opensuse;sles;ubuntu">
    <para>Some OpenStack packages generate and assign user IDs
      automatically during package installation. In these cases, the
      user ID value is not important. The existence of the user ID is
      what matters.

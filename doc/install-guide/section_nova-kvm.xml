    <title>Enable KVM on the compute node</title>

    <para>OpenStack Compute requires hardware virtualization support
        and certain kernel modules. Use the following procedure to
        determine whether your system has this support and the correct
        kernel modules and to enable KVM. In many cases, your
        distribution completes this installation and you do not need
        to perform any additional action.</para>

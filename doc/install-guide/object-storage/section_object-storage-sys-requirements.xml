                <td><para>The amount of disk space depends on how much
                        you can fit into the rack efficiently. You
                        want to optimize these for best cost per GB
                        while still getting industry-standard failure
                        rates. At Rackspace, our storage servers are
                        currently running fairly generic 4U servers
                        with 24 2T SATA drives and 8 cores of
                        processing power. RAID on the storage drives
                        is not required and not recommended. Swift's
                        disk usage pattern is the worst case possible
                        for RAID, and performance degrades very
                        quickly using RAID 5 or 6.</para>
                    <para>As an example, Rackspace runs Cloud Files
                        storage servers with 24 2T SATA drives and 8
                        cores of processing power. Most services
                        support either a worker or concurrency value
                        in the settings. This allows the services to
                        make effective use of the cores
                        available.</para></td>

                    <para>Optimize your proxy servers for best CPU
                        performance. The Proxy Services are more CPU
                        and network I/O intensive. If you are using 10
                        GB networking to the proxy, or are terminating
                        SSL traffic at the proxy, greater CPU power is
                        required.</para></td>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Operating system</emphasis>: OpenStack
        Object Storage currently runs on Ubuntu, RHEL, CentOS, Fedora,
        openSUSE, or SLES.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Networking</emphasis>: 1 Gbps or 10
        Gbps is suggested internally. For OpenStack Object Storage, an
        external network should connect the outside world to the proxy
        servers, and the storage network is intended to be isolated on
        a private network or multiple private networks.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Database</emphasis>: For OpenStack
        Object Storage, a SQLite database is part of the OpenStack
        Object Storage container and account management
        process.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Permissions</emphasis>: You can
        install OpenStack Object Storage either as root or as a user
        with sudo permissions if you configure the sudoers file to
        enable all the permissions.</para>

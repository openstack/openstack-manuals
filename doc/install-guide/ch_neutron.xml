        <para>This chapter is a bit more adventurous than we would
            like. We are working on cleanup and improvements to it.
            Like for the rest of the Installation Guide, feedback
            through bug reports and patches to improve it are
            welcome.</para>

        <title>Networking considerations</title>
        <para>OpenStack Networking drivers range from software bridges
            to full control of certain switching hardware. This guide
            focuses on the Open vSwitch driver. However, the theories
            presented here are mostly applicable to other mechanisms,
            and the <link

                    >Networking</link> chapter
            of the <citetitle>OpenStack Configuration Reference</citetitle>
            offers additional information.</para>

        <warning>
            <para>If you previously set up networking for your compute node by using
                    <systemitem class="service"
                    >nova-network</systemitem>, this configuration
                overrides those settings.</para>

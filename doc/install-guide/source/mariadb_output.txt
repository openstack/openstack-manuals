   NOTE: RUNNING ALL PARTS OF THIS SCRIPT IS RECOMMENDED FOR ALL
         MariaDB SERVERS IN PRODUCTION USE!
         PLEASE READ EACH STEP CAREFULLY!

   In order to log into MariaDB to secure it, we'll need the
   current password for the root user.  If you've just installed
   MariaDB, and you haven't set the root password yet, the
   password will be blank, so you should just press enter here.

   Enter current password for root (enter for none):
   OK, successfully used password, moving on...

   Setting the root password ensures that nobody can log into the
   MariaDB root user without the proper authorisation.

   Set root password? [Y/n] Y
   New password:
   Re-enter new password:
   Password updated successfully!
   Reloading privilege tables..
   ... Success!


   By default, a MariaDB installation has an anonymous user,
   allowing anyone to log into MariaDB without having to have a
   user account created for them.  This is intended only for
   testing, and to make the installation go a bit smoother.
   You should remove them before moving into a production
   environment.

   Remove anonymous users? [Y/n] Y
   ... Success!

   Normally, root should only be allowed to connect from
   'localhost'. This ensures that someone cannot guess at the
   root password from the network.

   Disallow root login remotely? [Y/n] Y
   ... Success!

   By default, MariaDB comes with a database named 'test' that
   anyone can access.  This is also intended only for testing,
   and should be removed before moving into a production
   environment.

   Remove test database and access to it? [Y/n] Y
   - Dropping test database...
     ... Success!
   - Removing privileges on test database...
     ... Success!

   Reloading the privilege tables will ensure that all changes
   made so far will take effect immediately.

   Reload privilege tables now? [Y/n] Y
   ... Success!

   Cleaning up...

   All done!  If you've completed all of the above steps, your
   MariaDB installation should now be secure.

   Thanks for using MariaDB!

"Conceptually, you can think of an Ethernet network as a single bus that each "
"of the network hosts connects to. In early implementations, an Ethernet "
"network consisted of a single coaxial cable that hosts would tap into to "
"connect to the network. Modern Ethernet networks do not use this approach, "
"and instead each network host connects directly to a network device called a "
"*switch*. Still, this conceptual model is useful, and in network diagrams "
"(including those generated by the OpenStack dashboard) an Ethernet network "
"is often depicted as if it was a single bus. You'll sometimes hear an "
"Ethernet network referred to as a *layer 2 segment*."

"In an Ethernet network, every host on the network can send a frame directly "
"to every other host. An Ethernet network also supports broadcasts, so that "
"one host can send a frame to every host on the network by sending to the "
"special MAC address ``ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff``. ARP_ and DHCP_ are two notable "
"protocols that use Ethernet broadcasts. Because Ethernet networks support "
"broadcasts, you will sometimes hear an Ethernet network referred to as a "
"*broadcast domain*."
msgstr ""

#: ../intro-basic-networking.rst:52
msgid ""
"When a NIC receives an Ethernet frame, by default the NIC checks to see if "
"the destination MAC address matches the address of the NIC (or the broadcast "
"address), and the Ethernet frame is discarded if the MAC address does not "
"match. For a compute host, this behavior is undesirable because the frame "
"may be intended for one of the instances. NICs can be configured for "
"*promiscuous mode*, where they pass all Ethernet frames to the operating "
"system, even if the MAC address does not match. Compute hosts should always "
"have the appropriate NICs configured for promiscuous mode."

"As mentioned earlier, modern Ethernet networks use switches to interconnect "
"the network hosts. A switch is a box of networking hardware with a large "
"number of ports, that forwards Ethernet frames from one connected host to "
"another. When hosts first send frames over the switch, the switch doesn’t "
"know which MAC address is associated with which port. If an Ethernet frame "
"is destined for an unknown MAC address, the switch broadcasts the frame to "
"all ports. The port learns which MAC addresses are at which ports by "
"observing the traffic. Once it knows which MAC address is associated with a "
"port, it can send Ethernet frames to the correct port instead of "
"broadcasting. The switch maintains the mappings of MAC addresses to switch "
"ports in a table called a *forwarding table* or *forwarding information "
"base* (FIB). Switches can be daisy-chained together, and the resulting "
"connection of switches and hosts behaves like a single network."

"VLAN is a networking technology that enables a single switch to act as if it "

"traffic. OpenStack is able to take advantage of VLANs to isolate the traffic "
"of different tenants, even if the tenants happen to have instances running "

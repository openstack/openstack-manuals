"As mentioned earlier, modern Ethernet networks use switches to interconnect "
"the network hosts. A switch is a box of networking hardware with a large "
"number of ports, that forwards Ethernet frames from one connected host to "
"another. When hosts first send frames over the switch, the switch doesn’t "
"know which MAC address is associated with which port. If an Ethernet frame "
"is destined for an unknown MAC address, the switch broadcasts the frame to "
"all ports. The port learns which MAC addresses are at which ports by "
"observing the traffic. Once it knows which MAC address is associated with a "
"port, it can send Ethernet frames to the correct port instead of "
"broadcasting. The switch maintains the mappings of MAC addresses to switch "
"ports in a table called a *forwarding table* or *forwarding information "
"base* (FIB). Switches can be daisy-chained together, and the resulting "
"connection of switches and hosts behaves like a single network."

"Conceptually, you can think of an Ethernet network as a single bus that each "
"of the network hosts connects to. In early implementations, an Ethernet "
"network consisted of a single coaxial cable that hosts would tap into to "
"connect to the network. Modern Ethernet networks do not use this approach, "
"and instead each network host connects directly to a network device called a "
"*switch*. Still, this conceptual model is useful, and in network diagrams "
"(including those generated by the OpenStack dashboard) an Ethernet network "
"is often depicted as if it was a single bus. You'll sometimes hear an "
"Ethernet network referred to as a *layer 2 segment*."

"In an Ethernet network, the hosts connected to the network communicate by "

"bits and is typically represented as a hexadecimal string, such as "
"``08:00:27:b9:88:74``. The MAC address is hard-coded into the NIC by the "

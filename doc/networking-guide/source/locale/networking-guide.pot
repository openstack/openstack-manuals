"As mentioned earlier, modern Ethernet networks use switches to interconnect "

"another. When hosts first send frames over the switch, the switch doesn’t "
"know which MAC address is associated with which port. If an Ethernet frame "

"all ports. The port learns which MAC addresses are at which ports by "
"observing the traffic. Once it knows which MAC address is associated with a "
"port, it can send Ethernet frames to the correct port instead of "
"broadcasting. The switch maintains the mappings of MAC addresses to switch "
"ports in a table called a *forwarding table* or *forwarding information "
"base* (FIB). Switches can be daisy-chained together, and the resulting "
"connection of switches and hosts behaves like a single network."

"The most common application programming interface (API) for writing TCP-"
"based applications is called *Berkeley sockets*, also known as *BSD sockets* "

"for writing TCP applications: from the perspective of a programmer, sending "
"data over a TCP connection is similar to writing a stream of bytes to a "
"file. It is the responsibility of the operating system's TCP/IP "

"system is also responsible for automatically retransmitting dropped packets, "

"overrun the sender's data buffers, receiver's data buffers, and network "
"capacity. Finally, the operating system is responsible for re-assembling the "
"packets in the correct order into a stream of data on the receiver's side. "
